Sadko\u2019s capital is BGN 50,000 and it is supposed\nto be dealing with \u201ctelecommunication activities and services\u201d. Only five\nmonths later, on May 23, 2008, Adoniev became Bulgarian citizen with Decree 56.\nThe proposal came from Petar Mutafchiev. The reason, according to the Minister,\nwas \u201ca distinct intention to make large-scale investments\u201d. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Obviously, after the speedy acquisition of a European\npassport, Sergei Adoniev&#8217;s large-scale intentions never materialized as for the\npast ten years the registered in Plovdiv Sadko has not reported any activity,\nexcept paying health and pension insurance for one person.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"600\" height=\"934\" src=\"https:\/\/bivol.bg\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/otchet-sadko.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-37969\" srcset=\"https:\/\/bivol.bg\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/otchet-sadko.png 600w, https:\/\/bivol.bg\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/otchet-sadko-193x300.png 193w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><figcaption> <br \/>One of the many empty annual financial reports of the Bulgarian company Sadko of Sergei Adoniev, (Archive: Bivol) <\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the issue with the Bulgarian citizenship of Sergei Adoniev\u2019s\nwife remains open.
