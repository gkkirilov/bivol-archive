The anecdotal has permeated the scientific to such an extent that sometimes it\u2019s been hard to distinguish one from the other. Some ideas, like the use of the anti-malarial drugs, have <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/world\/2020\/apr\/24\/chloroquine-study-coronavirus-brazil\"><span class=\"s2\">proved dangerous<\/span><\/a>; others, like President Trump\u2019s suggestion to inject disinfectant into the bloodstream, have been <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2020\/04\/26\/us\/politics\/trump-disinfectant-coronavirus.html\"><span class=\"s2\">downright mad<\/span><\/a>.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The long-awaited COVID-19 vaccine is of course one general solution to the problem, but even if our scientists manage to create one \u2013 which is far from certain at the moment \u2013 the clinical trials, certification, manufacturing and global distribution would take many months, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/interactive\/2020\/04\/30\/opinion\/coronavirus-covid-vaccine.html\"><span class=\"s2\">perhaps years<\/span><\/a>.\u00a0At this point, the best we could do as physicians is to come up with good enough solutions to keep patients, especially the critically ill, in a stable enough condition while they recover.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">One method of treatment that has received little public attention so far but has a very high potential to be effective against COVID-19 is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/topics\/medicine-and-dentistry\/plasma-exchange\"><span class=\"s2\">therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE),<\/span><\/a> also known as plasmapheresis. During the course of the illness, patients could experience abnormally elevated levels of inflammatory mediators in their blood (cytokines, for example, and various pathogenic proteins from decomposed cells, bacteria and viruses), which are known to lead to rapidly progressive septic shock, respiratory and organ failure, and eventually death. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">TPE, simply put, removes and replaces the plasma from a patient\u2019s blood through a special filtration device. It thus reduces the concentration of inflammatory mediators, as well as the actual viral load in the organism, helping the process of recovery. The procedure is generally low risk, with <a href=\"https:\/\/utswmed.org\/conditions-treatments\/therapeutic-plasma-exchange\/\"><span class=\"s2\">rare or no side effects<\/span><\/a>, and could be performed in a minimally invasive manner, using one or two peripheral veins of the hand. It could be especially beneficial for treating COVID-19 patients with moderate to severe symptoms.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">A large host of diseases have previously shown positive response to TPE treatment, including <a href=\"https:\/\/www.jscimedcentral.com\/Pharmacology\/pharmacology-2-1031.pdf\"><span class=\"s2\">multiple sclerosis<\/span><\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.karger.com\/Article\/Abstract\/245649\"><span class=\"s2\">hepatitis C<\/span><\/a> and some <a href=\"https:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1046\/j.1526-0968.1999.00147.x\"><span class=\"s2\">cancers<\/span><\/a>.

The initial results look encouraging, as <a href=\"https:\/\/ccforum.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/s13054-020-2836-4\"><span class=\"s2\">noted<\/span><\/a> by publications in peer-reviewed journals like <i>Critical Care<\/i>. In light of this, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration recently <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fda.gov\/news-events\/press-announcements\/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-authorizes-blood-purification-device-treat-covid-19?fbclid=IwAR1_A4rMrpflnrhYunXFpELTp19VIzcfiwPx36PLxR71Wv0m0VVEXUHx2G8\"><span class=\"s2\">issued<\/span><\/a> an emergency use authorization, approving TPE for treating patients with COVID-19.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In addition, plasma extracted from already cured individuals who have developed anti-bodies to COVID-19 could be reintroduced into sick patients as a form of passive immunization, the so-called \u201cconvalescent plasma therapy,\u201d already widely <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wired.com\/story\/the-race-to-get-convalescent-plasma-to-covid-19-patients\/\"><span class=\"s2\">covered<\/span><\/a> in the media. This, too, has shown <a href=\"https:\/\/jamanetwork.com\/journals\/jama\/fullarticle\/2763983\"><span class=\"s2\">promising results<\/span><\/a>, as reported by <i>The Journal of the American Medical Association<\/i> (JAMA).<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">It is important to note here that TPE is not and cannot be a panacea for COVID-19 and does not cure the root cause of the disease. It can only be a supportive therapy, giving time to the patient\u2019s organism to recover. Time, however, is sometimes the most valuable resource in medicine. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Fighting the effects of COVID-19 is a complex task with no simple or quick solutions. Social distancing measures, the use of personal protective equipment, as well as future vaccine and drug development remain the main pillars of any strategy. For people most critically affected by the disease however, therapeutic plasma exchange could prove a life-saver. The required equipment, knowledge and trained medical professionals are already in place in numerous countries. Of course, more and larger clinical trials are still needed to determine the real effectiveness of TPE treatment in COVID-19 patients, but governments around the world would be wise to explore further this simple, relatively inexpensive and very promising option. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>Prof. Dr. Plamen Kenarov is an anaesthesiologist and the Head of the Intensive Care Unit for Neurological Diseases at Tsaritsa Ioanna University Hospital in Sofia, Bulgaria.
