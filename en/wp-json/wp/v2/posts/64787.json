The owner of Transmobil acquired shares in TV Europe and arms dealer Emiliyan Gebrev was poisoned with a Novichok-type substance. The investigative website Bellingcat revealed that the attack on Gebrev was the work of GRU agents and linked Transmobil to the international \u201cSkripal\u201d scandal.<\/p>\n<p>The data on the transfers of Solidstar Worldwide to Transmobil emerged from the investigation by the Italian authorities against politician <strong>Luca Volonte<\/strong> in connection with the &#8220;Azerbaijani Laundromat&#8221;.

Currently, Dobrin Ivanov is the sole owner of Transmobil and owns TV Europe through another company associated with Delyan Peevski.<\/p>\n<p>Solidstar is also of particular interest to US financial intelligence.

He was arrested in 2008 and died after eleven months in police custody without a trial and adequate medical treatment. The scandal sparked an investigation in the United States and sanctions against Russian businessmen and officials. A law against corruption and money laundering, known as the Magnitsky Act, was passed by the US Congress and signed by President Barack Obama in December 2012.<\/p>\n<p>So far, however, only a small fraction of Russia&#8217;s missing millions have been found, as they have been syphoned through a complex network of offshore shell companies. The unraveling of the network continues to this day through a series of investigations known as the &#8220;Azerbaijani Laundromat&#8221;, the &#8220;Troika Laundromat&#8221; and the criminal prosecutions in Europe following these revelations. The transactions described in FinCEN&#8217;s secret reports are now added to this database.<\/p>\n<p>Bivol is the Bulgarian partner of the ICIJ, which organized a team of more than 400 journalists from 110 news organizations in 88 countries to examine more than 2,100 documents from the US Department of Treasury\u2019s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, FinCEN. The reports spanning the 2011-2017 period first leaked to BuzzFeed News which shared them with the ICIJ. ICIJ launched the publications known as the FinCen Files on September 20, 2020, in 108 media outlets around the world. They reveal shocking evidence of how global banks facilitate cash flows in the service of oligarchs, drug traffickers and terrorists.<\/p>\n<p>In the course of this journalistic investigation, Bivol obtained and analyzed more than 14,000 documents, including data from the Volonte investigation in Italy. The interception of data from various sources complements the picture of suspicious transactions and in this case connects them with the highest echelons of power in Bulgaria.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Owner of mouthpiece TV, proxy of Peevski<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>In 2015, <strong>Dobrin Ivanov<\/strong> became the co-owner of TV Europe through his company DP Investment.

According to Bellingcat, the attack against Gebrev with a Novichok-type substance was preceded by a forged note of Bulgaria\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the Azerbaijani Embassy for the supply by plane of weapons purchased by the Pentagon for the moderate rebels in Syria. The note initially included the name of Gebrev\u2019s arms manufacturing company Emco but it had been subsequently replaced with the names of two other companies, Transmobil and Alguns, as they had been the real exporters.<\/p>\n<p>The date of the diplomatic note coincides with the time of the first attack on Gebrev, Bellingcat said.

These constituted international transportation of stolen property in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2314.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>The further laundering engaged in by Megacom and Castlefront<\/strong>, in sending the funds through another company to Prevezon, and by Prevezon, in investing the funds first in Europe and then into New York real estate, constituted money laundering,\u201d further said the US government in its filing.<\/p>\n<p>The Prevezon case and the US government allegations have been extensively covered in the media since 2015. The case ended in 2017 with a settlement with US prosecutors, according to which Prevezon had to pay USD 6 million dollars to the United States.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_64735\" style=\"width: 2044px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https:\/\/bivol.bg\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/transmobile-solidstar-magnitsky.png\" data-rel=\"penci-gallery-image-content\" ><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-64735\" data-attachment-id=\"64735\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/bivol.bg\/en\/fincen-files-proxy-of-bulgarias-ruling-party-and-controversial-bulgarian-moguls-frontman-emerges-from-magnitsky-scheme.html\/transmobile-solidstar-magnitsky-2\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/bivol.bg\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/transmobile-solidstar-magnitsky.png\" data-orig-size=\"2034,1438\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"transmobile-solidstar-magnitsky\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/bivol.bg\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/transmobile-solidstar-magnitsky-300x212.png\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/bivol.bg\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/transmobile-solidstar-magnitsky-1024x724.png\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-64735\" src=\"https:\/\/bivol.bg\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/transmobile-solidstar-magnitsky.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"2034\" height=\"1438\" srcset=\"https:\/\/bivol.bg\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/transmobile-solidstar-magnitsky.png 2034w, https:\/\/bivol.bg\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/transmobile-solidstar-magnitsky-300x212.png 300w, https:\/\/bivol.bg\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/transmobile-solidstar-magnitsky-1024x724.png 1024w, https:\/\/bivol.bg\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/transmobile-solidstar-magnitsky-768x543.png 768w, https:\/\/bivol.bg\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/transmobile-solidstar-magnitsky-1536x1086.png 1536w, https:\/\/bivol.bg\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/transmobile-solidstar-magnitsky-1170x827.png 1170w, https:\/\/bivol.bg\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/transmobile-solidstar-magnitsky-1920x1357.png 1920w, https:\/\/bivol.bg\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/transmobile-solidstar-magnitsky-585x414.png 585w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2034px) 100vw, 2034px\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-64735\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Shell companies linked to the Magnitsky case and the Azerbaijdjani laundromat banking through Bulgarian Investbank<\/p><\/div>\n<p>It turns out that Castlefront has continued to operate undisturbed through its accounts in Europe despite its infamous reputation.<\/p>\n<p>The company has maintained an account in a Czech bank owned by multibillionaire and richest man in the Czech Republic <strong>Petr Kellner<\/strong>, Bivol\u2019s partners from the Czech investigative portal <a href=\"https:\/\/www.investigace.cz\/fincen-files-cesko\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Investigaze<\/a> revealed.

Bivol was a partner in this investigation. Its revelations are now confirmed by the FinCEN Files.<\/p>\n<p>The &#8220;Azerbaijani Laundromat&#8221; revealed that billions had moved through the Estonian branch of Danske Bank through shell companies. The money was used by Azerbaijan\u2019s ruling elite as \u201ca secret slush fund to pay off European politicians, buy luxury goods, launder money, and otherwise benefit themselves\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>For example, <strong>Solidstar<\/strong> received money from Jetfield Networks Limited, detected by the &#8220;Azerbaijani Laundromat&#8221; investigation for transfers to Italian politician <strong>Luca Volonte<\/strong>, the same FinCEN report, which examines Solidstar transfers from Investbank to Castelfront, reveals. Both companies are investigated in Italy as part of the probe into Volonte\u2019s activities. Jetfield is considered the third biggest contributor to the \u201cAzerbaijani Laundromat\u201d for having laundered EUR 2.9 billion for the regime in Baku.<\/p>\n<p>The FinCEN Files show that BNYM has identified footballer Javid Huseynov as the owner of Solidstar and Jetfield. He is most likely just a straw person, as the companies opened accounts in the Moscow bank International Financial Club OJSC in August 2015. This happened two weeks after Huseynov was arrested in connection with the death of a journalist.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_64718\" style=\"width: 1716px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https:\/\/bivol.bg\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/solidstar-jetfield-javid-sar.png\" data-rel=\"penci-gallery-image-content\" ><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-64718\" data-attachment-id=\"64718\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/bivol.bg\/en\/fincen-files-proxy-of-bulgarias-ruling-party-and-controversial-bulgarian-moguls-frontman-emerges-from-magnitsky-scheme.html\/solidstar-jetfield-javid-sar-2\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/bivol.bg\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/solidstar-jetfield-javid-sar.png\" data-orig-size=\"1706,896\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"solidstar-jetfield-javid-sar\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/bivol.bg\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/solidstar-jetfield-javid-sar-300x158.png\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/bivol.bg\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/solidstar-jetfield-javid-sar-1024x538.png\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-64718\" src=\"https:\/\/bivol.bg\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/solidstar-jetfield-javid-sar.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1706\" height=\"896\" srcset=\"https:\/\/bivol.bg\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/solidstar-jetfield-javid-sar.png 1706w, https:\/\/bivol.bg\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/solidstar-jetfield-javid-sar-300x158.png 300w, https:\/\/bivol.bg\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/solidstar-jetfield-javid-sar-1024x538.png 1024w, https:\/\/bivol.bg\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/solidstar-jetfield-javid-sar-768x403.png 768w, https:\/\/bivol.bg\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/solidstar-jetfield-javid-sar-1536x807.png 1536w, https:\/\/bivol.bg\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/solidstar-jetfield-javid-sar-1170x614.png 1170w, https:\/\/bivol.bg\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/solidstar-jetfield-javid-sar-585x307.png 585w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1706px) 100vw, 1706px\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-64718\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">BNMY identified the UBO of Solidstar &#8211; the football player Javid Hyuseinov, obviously a straw man\u00a0 Source: FinCen Files<\/p><\/div>\n<p>A Bulgarian also stood out among the beneficiaries of wires from the &#8220;Azerbaijani Laundromat&#8221;.

These three companies, together with Jetfield, are at the heart of the \u201cAzerbaijani Laundromat\u201d scheme.<\/p>\n<p>Mitrev said the money was for consulting services on land reclamation projects in Azerbaijan. The Bulgarian Prosecutor&#8217;s Office launched an investigation, which concluded that everything was legal.<\/p>\n<p>The companies that made transfers to Mitrev are also listed in Italy\u2019s Volonte case.<br \/>\nBivol and its ICIJ partners reviewed the case documents provided by L&#8217;Espresso. They show that bank transfers from Solidstar Worldwide in Estonia to Transmobil in Bulgaria have also attracted the attention of the anti-money laundering department of Danske Bank.<\/p>\n<p>Some of the offshore companies detected in the &#8220;Azerbaijani Laundromat&#8221; also appear in the \u201cTroika Laundromat\u201d investigation, which revealed how more than USD 200 billion was syphoned from Russia through the Estonian branch of Danske Bank.<\/p>\n<p>Castefront, the company investigated in the Magnitsky case, is also among them. It has allegedly moved nearly USD 400 million through its accounts. The same documents show that USD 23 million moved through Solidstar Worldwide&#8217;s accounts.<\/p>\n<p>But the FinCEN Files also make it clear that focusing on the accounts of the companies in the Estonian branch of Danske Bank would not be enough to reveal the full picture and scale of these laundromats and of the Magnitsky case.<\/p>\n<p>Just a handful of documents with fragmentary data show that Castelfront banks in the Czech Republic and Solidstar Worldwide banks in Bulgaria. At the same time, commissions of suspicious origin are flowing to an arms trading company linked to Bulgaria\u2019s ruling party, Bulgarian oligarch Peevski and the huge Novichok poisoning scandal.<\/p>\n<p>Assembling the puzzle requires lifting bank secrecy and aggressive actions by investigators in other European countries.<\/p>\n<p>However, the forecast for the success of such an investigation in Bulgaria is pessimistic due to the involvement of people with strong government ties and figures from the shadowy backstage rule.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A company of arms trader Dobrin Ivanov received large sums from an offshore company linked to the money laundering scheme uncovered by Moscow lawyer Sergei Magnitsky, the FinCEN Files and&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":16850,"featured_media":64762,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_mo_disable_npp":"","_relevanssi_hide_post":"","_relevanssi_pin_for_all":"","_relevanssi_pin_keywords":"","_relevanssi_unpin_keywords":"","_relevanssi_related_keywords":"","_relevanssi_related_include_ids":"","_relevanssi_related_exclude_ids":"","_relevanssi_related_no_append":"","_relevanssi_related_not_related":"","_relevanssi_related_posts":"","_relevanssi_noindex_reason":"","kia_subtitle":"","spay_email":"","jetpack_publicize_message":"","jetpack_is_tweetstorm":false},"categories":[5542,5806],"tags":[11546,5136,10049,9132,11517,11544,5123,9133,11547,11548,11545],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"https:\/\/bivol.bg\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/transmobile-fincen.jpg","jetpack_publicize_connections":[],"jetpack_sharing_enabled":true,"jetpack_shortlink":"https:\/\/wp.me\/p9hbsr-gQX","jetpack_likes_enabled":true,"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/bivol.bg\/en\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/64787"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/bivol.bg\/en\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/bivol.bg\/en\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/bivol.bg\/en\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/16850"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/bivol.bg\/en\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=64787"}],"version-history":[{"count":4,"href":"https:\/\/bivol.bg\/en\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/64787\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":64944,"href":"https:\/\/bivol.bg\/en\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/64787\/revisions\/64944"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/bivol.bg\/en\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/64762"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/bivol.bg\/en\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=64787"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/bivol.bg\/en\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=64787"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/bivol.bg\/en\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=64787"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
