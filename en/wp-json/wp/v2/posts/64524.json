The first offshore company is owned by a person involved in arms trafficking for the Islamic State and the other is owned by a notorious Bulgarian arms dealer, a partner of Boyan \u201cThe Baron\u201d Petrakiev. These data are found in the <strong>FinCEN Files<\/strong>, a cache of leaked suspicious activity reports (SARs) filed by banks and other financial firms with the US Department of Treasury\u2019s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, known in shorthand as FinCEN.<\/p>\n<p>The transfer in question was made on November 1, 2016. The company with an account in Piraeus Bank, which was acquired by Postbank in 2019, is called Heptagon Global Trading and is registered in Dubai. Piraeus sent USD 31 million to the account of the Seychelles-incorporated company Osiris Global Trade in the BDB. As the transfer was in US dollars, it went through the correspondent bank, Bank of New York Mellon. The US bank reported the suspicious transaction to FinCEN a month and a half later, in early 2017.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_64452\" style=\"width: 1474px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https:\/\/bivol.bg\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/osiris-heptagon-sar.png\" data-rel=\"penci-gallery-image-content\" ><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-64452\" data-attachment-id=\"64452\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/bivol.bg\/en\/fincen-files-state-controlled-bulgarian-bank-processes-transactions-linked-to-gangsters-and-arms-trafficking-for-islamic-state.html\/osiris-heptagon-sar-2\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/bivol.bg\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/osiris-heptagon-sar.png\" data-orig-size=\"1464,1678\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"osiris-heptagon-sar\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/bivol.bg\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/osiris-heptagon-sar-262x300.png\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/bivol.bg\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/osiris-heptagon-sar-893x1024.png\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-64452\" src=\"https:\/\/bivol.bg\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/osiris-heptagon-sar.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1464\" height=\"1678\" srcset=\"https:\/\/bivol.bg\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/osiris-heptagon-sar.png 1464w, https:\/\/bivol.bg\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/osiris-heptagon-sar-262x300.png 262w, https:\/\/bivol.bg\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/osiris-heptagon-sar-893x1024.png 893w, https:\/\/bivol.bg\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/osiris-heptagon-sar-768x880.png 768w, https:\/\/bivol.bg\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/osiris-heptagon-sar-1340x1536.png 1340w, https:\/\/bivol.bg\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/osiris-heptagon-sar-1170x1341.png 1170w, https:\/\/bivol.bg\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/osiris-heptagon-sar-585x671.png 585w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1464px) 100vw, 1464px\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-64452\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">\u0427\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0442\u0430 \u043e\u0442 \u0434\u043e\u043a\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0430 SAR, \u0432 \u043a\u043e\u0439\u0442\u043e \u0435 \u043e\u043f\u0438\u0441\u0430\u043d \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0432\u043e\u0434\u0430 \u0437\u0430 31 \u043c\u0438\u043b\u0438\u043e\u043d\u0430 \u0434\u043e\u043b\u0430\u0440\u0430 \u043c\u0435\u0436\u0434\u0443 \u0434\u0432\u0435 \u0431\u044a\u043b\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0431\u0430\u043d\u043a\u0438.<\/p><\/div>\n<p>The detailed report on the transaction notes that Heptagon Global Trading is registered in Dubai and has a <a href=\"http:\/\/heptagon-global.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">website<\/a> but it contains no information.

He is the son Gerhard Mertins, a German Nazi paratrooper, who participated in 1943 in the Gran Sasso raid of German paratroopers and Waffen-SS commandos of Otto Skorzeny, rescuing Benito Mussolini from prison. After World War II, Gerhard Mertins and Otto Skorzeny were recruited by the CIA. The two founded the arms trading company Merex AG, which secretly exported German weapons abroad for years with the blessing of the German secret services. Juan Manuel Contreras, the former head of the National Intelligence Directorate, Chile&#8217;s secret police during the dictatorship of General Augusto Pinochet, claims in his memoirs that Mertins has <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Gerhard_Mertins\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">supplied the Pinochet regime<\/a> with weapons and helicopters.<\/p>\n<p>Gerhard Mertins died in Florida in 1993. His son, <strong>Helmut Mertins<\/strong>, inherited the arms business and was also involved in scandalous deliveries. His company, United International Supplies, founded in 1987, trades in weapons from Eastern Europe.

Another company of Dimitrov, Alma De, also registered at 6 \u201cPop Bogomil\u201d Street, was involved in these explosions.<\/p>\n<p>The scandal with the dead American and the publications in the US and Bulgarian press in 2015 obviously have not harmed Dimitrov&#8217;s business with the United States. Despite them, he still received at the end of 2016 USD 31 million from a US arms dealer with a controversial reputation. Moreover, it happened with the cover-up of a State-controlled financial institution. In recent years, the BDB, itself, also gained the controversial reputation of a bank that finances oligarchs and politicians with State funds instead of supporting small businesses by granting them low-cost loans.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Silence by banks, institutions and intelligence<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>The fact that a State-owned bank, established to encourage the development of small and medium-sized Bulgarian enterprises, is moving tens of millions of dollars of a suspicious offshore company owned by a person linked to organized crime is obviously of great public interest. But the BDB did not answer Bivol\u2019s questions sent by e-mail.<\/p>\n<p>In search of answers, Bivol approached the press office of the Ministry of Finance, which is in charge of the BDB. All attempts to obtain information on how it is possible for the offshore company Osiris Global Trade owned by a person with the reputation of Alexander Dimitrov to have a dollar account in the State bank were unsuccessful. Vladislav Goranov from the ruling Citizens for European Development of Bulgaria party (GERB) was the Minister of Finance at the time when the account was opened. Goranov resigned recently amid mass street protests against the GERB government.<\/p>\n<p>A bank transfer of USD 31 million (BGN 50 million) would hardly go unnoticed by the services responsible for national security, especially when it is associated with the strictly regulated and scrutinized arms business. But Bivol\u2019s questions sent to the National Security Agency (DANS), specifically addressed to its Financial Intelligence Directorate, remained unanswered.<\/p>\n<p>Maybe Dimitrov owes this protection to the &#8220;influential people&#8221; to whom he has been recommended not by anyone, but by a prominent Bulgarian organized crime figure? Whoever they are, apparently their influence reaches the highest levels in Bulgaria since \u201cThe Baron&#8217;s\u201d partner has been granted the opportunity to bank in the BDB. And, of course, it would be important to find out how many more such offshore and suspicious entities are moving dollar transactions worth millions through the State bank.<\/p>\n<p><em>Bivol is a partner of the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists <a href=\"http:\/\/icij.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ICIJ<\/a>, which has organized a team of more than 400 journalists from 110 news organizations in 88 countries to examine more than 2,100 documents from the US Department of Treasury\u2019s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, FinCEN.
