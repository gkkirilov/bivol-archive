Bivol has obtained this non-public documentation for dozens of projects <strong>totaling BGN hundreds of millions<\/strong>. These include <strong>accounting files with explicitly earmarked bribes<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>The revelations involve projects under the Regional Development Program (RDP), the Operational Programs and the Energy Efficiency Program. Consultants are directly benefiting from the so-called <strong><em>soft projects<\/em><\/strong> &#8211; external technical assistance under operational programs, project management and reporting, consultancies, awareness raising, research and impact assessment, publicity, etc. As a rule, they are for amounts ranging from several tens to several hundred thousands.<\/p>\n<p>They are followed by <strong><em>hard projects<\/em><\/strong> for construction of buildings, roads, water pipes, landfills, building refurbishment, etc. where the amounts are for millions and tens of millions. The same network of consultancy firms deals with public procurement contracts for large construction companies, manipulates documentation and pre-determines results through their dummies in evaluation committees.<\/p>\n<p>Several completed projects related to the company \u201c<strong>GP Group<\/strong>\u201d reveal how the theft from the projects is being carried out. There are parallel bills of quantities, less work is done than planned, fewer materials are used, but everything is invoiced to the paying body as per job order and the companies receive the full amount.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The difference of 30-40% is the lethal \u201ccorruption\u201d tax, which can actually kill, as the recent tragedy with a deadly road crash near the Bulgarian town of Svoge showed<\/strong>. Because in the conditions of pervasive corruption it is unlikely that the \u201cGP\u201d scheme is an exception and the others would be all clean and all in white. Most likely, there are several such networks in the country around all major players in the public procurement market and the absorption of EU funds.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Through commission fees to prosperity<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>In order to submit successful bids and advance projects seamlessly, consultancy companies distribute bribes at all levels &#8211; from a deputy minister to auditors and experts, according to the secret accounting books of the companies \u201c<strong>Rila Consult\u201d, \u201cEuroprogramconsult\u201d, \u201cM Consult Finance\u201d, &#8220;EU Energy Project&#8221; and &#8220;Lian Consult Services&#8221;<\/strong>.

This makes over 55% of the revenues. See all the data in this file &#8211; <a href=\"https:\/\/bivol.bg\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/otchet-general.xlsx\">otchet-general<\/a> (in Bulgarian). The file also shows that the profits of the three owners &#8211; Lily, Tanya and Petar &#8211; exceeded thirty times the wage fund for the whole period for all workers in the companies.<\/p>\n<p>All revenues and expenses of the companies for salaries, office, cars, remaining profit and a special column &#8220;Commission&#8221; are listed in detail in the secret parallel accounting books, which are not for the outside eyes. In them, the beneficiaries are usually identified by first name or the name of the institution, and there are some very intriguing abbreviations.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Feeding stations for the institutions<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>For example: <strong>Mayor Vn<\/strong>. &#8211; 45,000 in December 2013, <strong>Mayor Vn<\/strong>. 16,185 in March 2014, <strong>Vn &#8211; km<\/strong> \u2013 35,000 in April 2014, <strong>Vidin -k<\/strong> \u2013 10,000 in September 2014.<\/p>\n<p>At the same time \u201cRila Consult\u201d was implementing the project <strong><em>&#8220;Implementation of External Technical Assistance to Assist the Municipality of Vidin in the Implementation and Management of Project &#8220;Rehabilitation and Extension of the Water Supply and Sewerage Systems in Vidin, Bulgaria&#8221;<\/em><\/strong> worth BGN 497,000. If Mayor Vn. and Vn-km are the same person and they are related to the project in Vidin, it can be concluded that only this person has absorbed 21% of the project\u2019s amount.<\/p>\n<p>Apart from Mayor Vn., one can also find in the accounting books <strong>Vn Stanislava &#8211; Vidin Audit<\/strong> &#8211; 5,200 in December 2013, <strong>Stanislava \u2013 Vidin mng<\/strong> &#8211; 9,920 in December 2013, <strong>Stanislava Vn<\/strong> &#8211; 5,705 in March 2014, <strong>Stanislava audit Vn<\/strong> &#8211; 7,750 in April 2014, <strong>Stanislava tech assist<\/strong> \u2013 13,520 in April 2014, <strong>Stanislava Vn<\/strong> \u2013 8,000 in July 2014.<\/p>\n<p>Stanislava, however, is not just from Vn. In May 2014, we have <strong>Stanislava MEWs<\/strong> (Ministry of Environment and Waters \u2013 editor\u2019s note) <strong>writing procedure<\/strong>s with a commission fee of BGN 6,000. In September 2014, 23,705 were given to <strong>Stanislava MEWs climate and diffusers<\/strong>, and in December &#8211; another 10,000 to <strong>Stanislava, audit MEWs<\/strong>. Stanislava has received 89,800 in commission fees.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Stanislava MEWs climate and diffusers<\/strong> can probably be explained with the project <strong><em>&#8220;Study and Assessment of the Impact of Diffuse Sources of Pollution on Surface Waters&#8221;<\/em><\/strong> with the participation of <strong>&#8220;Europrogramconsult&#8221;<\/strong>, for which the MEWs has paid BGN 487,000 (see <a href=\"https:\/\/contracts.bivol.bg\/view.php?id=29135\">here<\/a>). In addition, the same company has a contract with the MEWs for <strong><em>&#8220;Development of a National Program for Conservation, Sustainable Use and Restoration of Soil Functions&#8221;<\/em><\/strong> for BGN 139,500 (see <a href=\"https:\/\/contracts.bivol.bg\/view.php?id=29191\">here<\/a>), and in the meantime \u201cRila Consult\u201d is \u201cworking hard\u201d on <strong><em>&#8220;Assessment of the Pressure and Impact on Surface and Groundwater from Climate Change and Assessment of the Availability of Water for the Economic Sectors&#8221;<\/em><\/strong>, for which the MEWs has paid BGN 607,000,000 (see <a href=\"https:\/\/contracts.bivol.bg\/view.php?id=29152\">here<\/a>).<\/p>\n<p>All this can be linked to the two entries from February 2015. <strong>MEWs deputy<\/strong> &#8211; 32,812 and <strong>Deputy MEWs<\/strong> \u2013 32,810.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to the MEWs, the companies from this \u201cconstellation\u201d have projects funded by the Regional Inspectorate of Environment and Waters (RIOEWs) &#8211; Sofia for <strong><em>&#8220;Marking with Permanent Signs on Location the Boundaries of Reserves and Maintained Reserves, Cleaning and Marking of Eco Trails on the Territory of \u201cBogdan\u201d\u201d<\/em><\/strong> with BGN 150,000, the RIEWs Smolyan for <strong><em>&#8220;Marking with Permanent Signs on Location the Boundaries of Reserves and Maintained Reserves&#8221;<\/em><\/strong> with BGN 98,000 and a project labeled only as RIEWs for \u201cDeveloping Management Plans for Protected Areas\u201d: reserve \u201cTorfeno Branishte\u201d, reserve \u201cBistrishko Branishte\u201d, maintained reserve \u201cSchool Forest\u201d, maintained reserve \u201cBogdan\u201d with BGN 797,000,00.<\/p>\n<p>However, the commission fees for RIEWs seem quite mingy against the backdrop of the amounts that are being absorbed. 8,000 in October 2014 for the <strong>RIEWs &#8211; Smolyan<\/strong> and another 8,000 in February 2015, when some 50,000 for <strong>GP RIEWs<\/strong> have been entered. On the other hand, the \u201cBogdan\u201d project for eco-trails is reflected in several entries: <strong>Bogdan PPA<\/strong> BGN 6,000 + 4000 January 2014 and <strong>Bogdan PPA<\/strong> BGN 25,000 + 12 000 in June 2014.<\/p>\n<p>They are followed by municipal projects funded mainly under the <strong>Rural Development Program <\/strong>(RDP), where commissions are more moderate.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cRila Consult\u201d is implementing the project &#8220;<strong><em>External Technical Assistance to Assist the Municipality of Sevlievo in the Management of the Project &#8220;Investment Project for Rehabilitation and Extension of Sewerage and Sewerage Network in Sevlievo<\/em><\/strong>&#8221; funded by the MEWs. It is worth BGN 523,000 for 18 months. The contract was signed on August 12, 2013, and in January 2014, a commission fee for <strong>MEWs Sevlievo<\/strong> \u2013 33,000 &#8211; has been entered. In the same month, a strange <strong>Fine Sevlievo<\/strong> 52,300 has been entered as well. Sevlievo \u2013 10,000 appears in June 2014, and in August &#8211; Ivo &#8211; negotiation Sevlievo &#8211; \u00a0BGN 2,000.<\/p>\n<p>From the following entry for August &#8211; <strong>Ivo PPA Assenovgrad \u2013 6,000<\/strong> and <strong>Ivo Pravets \u2013 19,200<\/strong>, one can conclude that some Ivo from the Public Procurement Agency (PPA) is helping to negotiate the projects and receives commission fees accordingly. Moreover, Ivo seems to be a regular \u201ccustomer\u201d. <strong>Ivo PPA<\/strong> received 4,000 in October 2014, <strong>Ivo PPA Sopot<\/strong> received 2,000 the same month, <strong>Ivo per contr. from Pravets<\/strong> got 11,120 in June 2014, <strong>Ivo Razlog<\/strong> got 6,000 again in June, and so on. Without making absolutely no statement, there is a reason to turn our attention to the then-Chief Secretary of the Agency, Ivo Katsarov.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cRila Consult\u201d runs two RDP projects funded by the State Fund Agriculture (SFA) for the municipality of Etropole (<a href=\"https:\/\/contracts.bivol.bg\/view.php?id=57853\">here<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/contracts.bivol.bg\/view.php?id=57854\">here<\/a>) for BGN 60,000 each. In the form of a commission fee, this is materialized by the entry <strong>Etropole SFA<\/strong> &#8211; BGN 15,000 in November 2014. The initials of the SFA appear several times for different amounts and different projects: <strong>SFA Razlog<\/strong> \u2013 15,000, <strong>Svilengrad SFA<\/strong> \u2013 2,200, <strong>SFA Rudozem<\/strong> coordination \u2013 1,000.<\/p>\n<p>There are no names but the commission fees for <strong>Auditor Commission<\/strong> &#8211; 700 and <strong>Competitiveness<\/strong> &#8211; 18,000, are quite indicative.<\/p>\n<p>Thus, in reality, <strong>all institutions responsible for the distribution of money from the European funds are covered<\/strong>, i.e. have received a commission fee from the companies that have won the projects.<\/p>\n<p>Not all the money from the &#8220;commissions&#8221; column, however, has been bribes of officials. Significant amounts have been paid to major construction companies such as \u201cGlavbolgarstroy\u201d (GBS), \u201cGP Group\u201d and \u201cISA 2000\u201d. These companies are also contractors in large construction projects worth BGN hundreds of millions, which had been obviously won with the decisive help of the consultants and their commissioning skills. The huge amount of documentation in our possession leads to this conclusion.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Large cash flows <\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>There is also a revenue column in the accounting books and the entries there are also extremely interesting. They show that several million have come from only one person named <strong>Tedi<\/strong>. Other people contributing large sums of money include <strong>Tundzhay<\/strong> (110,000), <strong>Joro Razlog<\/strong> (77,000), <strong>Radi<\/strong> (55,000), <strong>Indzhov<\/strong> (20,000), <strong>Pacho Razlog<\/strong> (10,000), etc..<\/p>\n<p>In addition, large sums of money have been received from individuals in the form of loans and other payments: <strong>TB loan from VAT of Tanya and Lily<\/strong> &#8211; 20,000, <strong>Petar for cars on the ESB&#8217;s account<\/strong> &#8211; 120,000, <strong>loan from Tanya and Petar<\/strong> &#8211; 200,000.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_42844\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https:\/\/bivol.bg\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/gp-rila-cash.png\" data-rel=\"penci-gallery-image-content\" ><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-42844\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-42844 size-medium\" src=\"https:\/\/bivol.bg\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/gp-rila-cash-300x257.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"257\" srcset=\"https:\/\/bivol.bg\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/gp-rila-cash-300x257.png 300w, https:\/\/bivol.bg\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/gp-rila-cash-768x659.png 768w, https:\/\/bivol.bg\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/gp-rila-cash-1024x879.png 1024w, https:\/\/bivol.bg\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/gp-rila-cash-1440x1236.png 1440w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-42844\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Click to enlarge: Hundreds of thousands of revenue from \u201cGP Group\u201d and \u201cGBS\u201d and millions of expenditures in cash<\/p><\/div>\n<p>Another file, summarizing the revenues and costs of one of the companies shows that between July 2013 and June 2014 over BGN 2 million has been paid in cash (see <a href=\"https:\/\/bivol.bg\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/Book1T-14.xls\">Book1T (14)<\/a><\/p>\n<p>For the same period, the company has received more than BGN 300,000 from the \u201cGP Group\u201d and nearly BGN 200,000 from \u201cGBS\u201d.
