The property was purchased for 20.6 million euros in the autumn of 2008. Further information also points to Bozhkov as the owner of another expensive property near the Arc de Triomphe, the price of which is currently yet unknown. According to documents seen by Bivol, the property was bought by a company registered in France and owned by Vassil Bozhkov. The money for the investment came from an offshore firm, which according to the Panama Papers has also been owned by Bozhkov himself since 2003. Files from the offshore business registers show that he used another offshore company he owned in order to invest in aircraft.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Several days ago the Commission for Illegal Assets Forfeiture (CIAF) announced with some fanfare that it had put a lien on Vassil Bozhkov&#8217;s properties. There are 17 charges against the oligarch, who is currently in hiding in Dubai. The estimated total worth of the assets is 406,547,219 Bulgarian levs (BGN). Among them are flats in Sofia and Balchik, a house in Greece and real estate in Paris, according to CIAF&#8217;s public announcement. In addition, a claim has been filed for the seizure of a yacht worth 1,100,000 BGN and a Bombardier aircraft with an estimated market value of 34,000,000 BGN. According to current market data, the property in the central parts of Paris which we are looking at is worth approximately 70 million euro or 135 million BGN. That would amount to a third of the overall property value sought by CIAF. Bivol has spent the last few months investigating the Paris purchase.<\/p>\n<h2>Authorities are guarding the secret over Bozhkov&#8217;s Paris mysteries<\/h2>\n<p>Six months ago Bivol asked CIAF if a procedure to put a lien on Bozhkov&#8217;s Paris properties had been initiated, as information about them was publicly available in the French business registry. Two companies owned by Vassil Bozhkov can be found there: \u00a0SCI BO\u00a0and\u00a0SCI BOTWO. SCI stands for Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Civile Immobili\u00e8re, the legal phrasing for a specific type of company established for the purpose of managing real estate. Both companies were founded in the autumn of 2008, just before the purchase of the properties.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_71106\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https:\/\/bivol.bg\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/SCI-BO-scaled.jpg\" data-rel=\"penci-gallery-image-content\" ><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-71106\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-71106 size-medium\" src=\"https:\/\/bivol.bg\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/SCI-BO-300x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/bivol.bg\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/SCI-BO-300x300.jpg 300w, https:\/\/bivol.bg\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/SCI-BO-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/bivol.bg\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/SCI-BO-150x150.jpg 150w, https:\/\/bivol.bg\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/SCI-BO-768x768.jpg 768w, https:\/\/bivol.bg\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/SCI-BO-1536x1536.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/bivol.bg\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/SCI-BO-2048x2048.jpg 2048w, https:\/\/bivol.bg\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/SCI-BO-1170x1170.jpg 1170w, https:\/\/bivol.bg\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/SCI-BO-1920x1920.jpg 1920w, https:\/\/bivol.bg\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/SCI-BO-585x585.jpg 585w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-71106\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">SCI BO registration document listing Vassil Bozhkov as the sole owner.<\/p><\/div>\n<p>SCI BO\u00a0was registered on 3 September 2008, initially at 133 boulevard Haussmann.

SCI BO also agrees to pay the offshore company 15% of the profit in the event that it sells the building. No principal repayments or interest from SCI BO would be due over the first three years. A mortgage is established over the building, with Variety Finance SA as the beneficiary.<\/p>\n<p>The timing of the investment at the end of 2008 was significant \u2013 property prices were collapsing globally as well as in France due to the financial crisis. The average property price in the particular area, however, never went any lower than 10,000 euro per square meter. For 20 million euro Bozhkov managed to acquire several floors in a prestigious building and most probably the entire building itself. The contracts initially contain the word \u201capartment\u201d but later on they speak of \u201cthe building\u201d as a whole and the \u201cproperty\u201d at the 27 Quai Anatole France in its entirety. The address is now also registered as the French company&#8217;s official seat. According to local real estate companies, the total floor area of the seven-story buildingis around 3500 square meters.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_70955\" style=\"width: 234px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https:\/\/bivol.bg\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/variety-scibo-pret.png\" data-rel=\"penci-gallery-image-content\" ><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-70955\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-70955 size-medium\" src=\"https:\/\/bivol.bg\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/variety-scibo-pret-224x300.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"224\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/bivol.bg\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/variety-scibo-pret-224x300.png 224w, https:\/\/bivol.bg\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/variety-scibo-pret-763x1024.png 763w, https:\/\/bivol.bg\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/variety-scibo-pret-768x1030.png 768w, https:\/\/bivol.bg\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/variety-scibo-pret-1145x1536.png 1145w, https:\/\/bivol.bg\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/variety-scibo-pret-1527x2048.png 1527w, https:\/\/bivol.bg\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/variety-scibo-pret-1170x1569.png 1170w, https:\/\/bivol.bg\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/variety-scibo-pret-585x785.png 585w, https:\/\/bivol.bg\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/variety-scibo-pret.png 1746w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 224px) 100vw, 224px\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-70955\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Loan agreement between Variety Finance SA and SCI BO, dated 2008<\/p><\/div>\n<p>Property in the 7<sup>th<\/sup> arrondissement costs over 16,000 euro per square meter at the moment and for a prime location on the banks of the Seine that price can go up to 25,000 euro.

His Swiss fiduciary services company Ilex Trustees\u00a0was entrusted by Vassil Bozhkov with the management of Variety Finance S.A. already in 2003. The company was registered on the British Virgin Islands at the time but was later re-registered in Panama.

In his last few weeks in Bulgaria, when his war with Peevski and Borissov for control over his gambling business had already started, he would travel to Paris and back more than once a week. Bivol checked the flight registers for his private jet LZ-VBE and they show that he travelled to Paris as often as one might visit a weekend home in the outskirts of town. The oligarch also flew to Moscow several times in the last few days before he was given the status of \u201ccriminal number one\u201d by the Procecution.<\/p>\n<p>Since the beginning of 2019 SCI BO, the French company in possession of the luxury property in Paris, is no longer managed by a \u201cstraw person\u201d as traditionally done in the past. It is now in the hands of one of Bozhkov&#8217;s most trusted protegees Miroslav Iliev. He is linked to over 30 companies in the business empire of the Skull, a nickname by which Bozhkov is widely known.

However, Bozhkov&#8217;s construction companies went bankrupt and were acquired by persons linked to First Investment Bank in compensation for huge debts owed to the financial institution. This indicates that the \u201ccleaning up\u201d is actually a large-scale operation for laundering money acquired through criminal activities through the use of bank loans. The Paris real estate transaction carries some of the same traits \u2013 money from an offshore business secretely owned by Bozhkov is loaned to a \u201cclean\u201d French company in which he is officially a partner.<\/p>\n<p>After exiting the construction business, Bozhkov developed his \u201cNational Lottery\u201d, selling scratch cards through the kiosks of the Lafka network, whose ownership has been linked to parliament member Delyan Peevski.<\/p>\n<p>Up until early 2020 Bozhkov enjoyed total impunity and privilege from the state, which provided him with a service passport (read more <a href=\"https:\/\/bivol.bg\/dineva-service-passport.html\">here<\/a>), while the GERB administration proposed and voted legal changes in favour of his gambling business through parliament.<\/p>\n<p>It is not clear what caused the abrupt change in attitude towards Bulgaria&#8217;s richest man but it was most likely brought about by a business conflict with Borissov and Peevski, whom Bozhkov now calls \u201cSiamese twins\u201d and \u201ca junta\u201d. After positioning himself as a whistle-blower, the businessman has made a foray into politics and has been promising new disclosures of corruption, accompanied by documents and proof, which he has so far not presented.<\/p>\n<p>Bivol reached out to Vassil Bozhkov for comments via email and through his official Facebook profile.
