The Libyans have\nobeyed the order of the border police to allow them on board. About 30 persons,\narmed with various weapons, have boarded the vessel, including uniformed border\npolice officers and an inspector from the Maritime Administration in the city\nof Burgas. According to the Libyan crew, there have been thugs among them and\nthey have enjoyed special attention and visible privileges on the part of the civil\nservants. The captain, his deputies and the sailors have been threatened, cursed,\nbeaten and forcibly removed from the ship. According to their testimony, the armed\nmen have behaved like assailants &#8211; openly aggressive and rude. They have\nliterally taken the ship by storm and have warned everyone not to make phone\ncalls, pointing guns at them. All members of the crew have been forced to disembark\nthe tanker and have been deported from Bulgaria. The 62,000-ton MT BADR tanker\nleft the Bulgarian territorial waters on December 27, under a Panamanian flag, under\na new name -BDIN and with a Ukrainian command.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Was this a replacement of the crew following an ordinary\ntrade dispute or an unprecedented hijacking of a huge ship in the territorial\nwaters of the European Union? <strong>Bivol<\/strong>&#8216;s\ninvestigation found that the raid involved dubious from a legal viewpoint\nactions of a private law enforcement agent (PLEA) and of a number of Bulgarian\ninstitutions in favor of <strong>persons related\nto the Italian mafia, the Bulgarian bank Investbank and the Titan waste\nmanagement company<\/strong>. We established conclusively that the latter have used <strong>fake documents<\/strong> to change the ship\nownership in an unlawful way.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead of thwarting the mafia raid, the Bulgarian State,\nrepresented by its institutions, has actually helped to hijack the ship owned\nby the Libyan national shipping company General National Maritime Transport\nCompany of Libya (GNMTC). The actions against the Libyans have involved an\nunprecedented physical abuse and humiliation of the sailors and personally of\nCaptain <strong>Abdullah Abdul Jalil<\/strong>, who\nhas been brutally insulted, beaten and kicked by border police officers and has\nbeen prohibited to even make a phone call to the ship owner. The cellular\nnetwork has been muffled within a radius of 200 meters with a special device\nbrought on the cutter. As the Captain has somehow managed to establish a\nconnection through his satellite phone, one of the thugs has forcefully pulled\nthe phone out of his hands, damaging it and interrupting the conversation. The\nLibyans have been terrified and stressed and left without a right to any\nprotection or to a fair reaction. The official report of the captain to the\nLibyan authorities reveals incredible and outrageous details about the behavior\nof the Bulgarian border police officers, accompanied by private guards and the\ncontenders to seize the tanker. Bivol possesses the Captain\u2019s detailed testimony\nabout the fatal December 21, when he became an unsuspecting victim of the\n&#8220;pirate&#8221; raid to conquer his ship and will publish it after a translation\nand a transcription. It is 45-minutes long.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a rel=\"attachment wp-att-44176\" href=\"https:\/\/bivol.bg\/en\/badr-mafia-burgas.html\/screen-shot-2019-01-01-at-13-30-13\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"313\" height=\"356\" class=\"wp-image-44176 \" src=\"https:\/\/bivol.bg\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/Screen-Shot-2019-01-01-at-13.30.13-264x300.png\" data-rel=\"penci-gallery-image-content\"  alt=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/bivol.bg\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/Screen-Shot-2019-01-01-at-13.30.13-264x300.png 264w, https:\/\/bivol.bg\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/Screen-Shot-2019-01-01-at-13.30.13.png 598w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 313px) 100vw, 313px\" \/><\/a> <br \/><a rel=\"attachment wp-att-44179\" href=\"https:\/\/bivol.bg\/en\/badr-mafia-burgas.html\/screen-shot-2019-01-01-at-13-36-35\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"316\" height=\"367\" class=\"wp-image-44179 \" src=\"https:\/\/bivol.bg\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/Screen-Shot-2019-01-01-at-13.36.35-258x300.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/bivol.bg\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/Screen-Shot-2019-01-01-at-13.36.35-258x300.png 258w, https:\/\/bivol.bg\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/Screen-Shot-2019-01-01-at-13.36.35.png 637w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 316px) 100vw, 316px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Story as in a movie script<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The story of the\nmafia-style attack on the Libyan tanker BADR goes back to 1992. The former State-owned\nduring the time of the Communist regime and scandalous company <strong>Bulgargeomin<\/strong>, then filed claims against\nthe Libyan shipping company for about USD 9 million. This claim had been\ndisputed by the Libyan side, and there had been court cases in the Arab Jamahiriya.\nEverything has gradually dissipated over the years amidst the changes that have\ntaken place in the two former socialist countries, until a quarter of a century\nlater, when a company was registered under the Law on Obligations and\nContracts, under the same name as the former State holding but without any\nlegal connection to it &#8211; <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.bulgargeomin.com\/\">&#8220;Bulgargeomin Ltd&#8221;<\/a><\/strong>. The\nconsortium is made up of three private companies with a brief track record, but\npretending to be the successor of the former State company Bulgargeomin. The\nill-fated Libyan tanker that arrived at the Burgas port in November 2017 had\nbeen chosen as a scape-goat. The ship was arrested then at the request of the\nnew Bulgargeomin for the purpose of securing a future receivable and remained\nanchored there under the order of the Maritime Administration. Bulgargeomin Ltd\nis basing its claim on a maritime mortgage agreement between them and the\nLibyan company, worth USD 9.23 million. Based on this claim, the Burgas court\nhas accepted the collateral and the Maritime Administration has arrested the\ntanker. The ensuing lengthy court saga ended with the release of the ship after\nthe final rule of the Supreme Court of Cassations (SCC). On the very same day,\nhowever, new claims to the ship were made, this time through the Burgas private\nlaw enforcement agent (PLEA) Totko Kolev, who had initiated a case for the sale\nof the ship at the request of the claimant and on the basis of the official\nmortgage documentation. The ship was arrested once again.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As is always the case with any suspicious, criminal, corrupt\nand illegal actions, just in the afternoon on Friday December 21, before the\nChristmas and New Year holidays, when most institutions are closed, the main\nactors decided to put an end to their unsuccessful attempts to take over the\nLibyan ship once and for all. The events seem truly astonishing in their\nbrutality and would seem plausible if they had happened in the Somali waters\nand not in the territorial waters of a State that is a full-pledged member of\nthe European Union.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The report was read in full on the phone to Bivol\u2019s\neditorial office by the company&#8217;s insurance agent <strong>Mohamed El Ahrech<\/strong>. He said that a crisis headquarters had been\nestablished by the company in Tripoli.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Here is a summary <\/strong>of\nCaptain Abdul Jalil\u2019s firsthand account and of his report to the GNMTC made on\nDecember 24:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On December 21, 2018 at 12:20 pm the Captain was informed on\nthe VHF\u2019s Channel H by the Border Burgas Traffic that a ship of border police\nand Maritime Administration was approaching the tanker. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Two cutters approached the tanker with 30 people descending\non it, including uniformed border police officers, armed guards from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Bashev-Security-Team-561006417420415\/\">Bashev Team\n&amp; Security<\/a>, Maritime Administration officers, and civilians who\npresented themselves as the new owners of the ship. They forbade the captain to\ncontact the tanker\u2019s owner and muted the ship&#8217;s communications with special\nequipment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Border police officers began to check the crew\u2019s passports,\nand civilians, who presented themselves as Maritime Administration officers,\ntold the Captain that the ship already had another owner and he had to disembark\nit with his crew. The Captain insisted on seeing documents for the change of\nownership, but none had been presented to him.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the muted communications, he managed to get in touch\nwith the Libyan company from a stationary satellite phone and reported that the\nship had been hijacked. When the assailants realized that he had been talking\nto Tripoli, one of the guards struck him and pulled the phone cable out. This\nhappened before the eyes of Bulgarian border police officers who did not react.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-audio\"><audio controls src=\"https:\/\/bivol.bg\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/captain-badr-1.ogg\"><\/audio><figcaption>The recording is over 45-minutes long<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;<strong><em>At that moment, I realized that the police\nwere here to protect the attackers and had no power,&#8221; says the Captain.\n&#8220;All the power was in the guards.

The Captain, however, signaled to the crew not to leave the ship. At that moment, he was attacked by the guards, and one of the civilians, who had presented himself as the owner of the ship, screamed: &#8220;If you want to see your family again, do not <g class=\"gr_ gr_6 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear ContextualSpelling ins-del\" id=\"6\" data-gr-id=\"6\">do<\/g> act stupid.

Get off my ship.&#8221; <\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As Abdul Jalil continued to resist in the hope that he would\nbe contacted back by phone by the Libyan owner of the ship, the guards and\npolicemen lost patience and resorted to physical aggression.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;<strong><em>One of the two officers was very nervous&#8230;\nHe kicked me in the back and I fell.

He even remembers a <strong>gray &#8220;Audi&#8221; with license plate number CB4907KT<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The crew remained at the border police precinct until 9 pm,\nguarded by private guards the entire time. The police took the Captain&#8217;s mobile\nphone and to his surprise handed it over to the private guards.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;<strong><em>Again, it became obvious that the police did\nnot have any power; all the power was in the private guards<\/em><\/strong>,&#8221; he\nsays.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then the Captain was taken by the guards to a hotel in the\nBlack Sea city of Varna, where he has been contacted by the person claiming to be\nthe new owner of the ship.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;<strong><em>Look, this is just business. It does not\nbother us. Before you do anything, think about your life and your family<\/em><\/strong>,&#8221;\nhe told him.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the next day, December 22, the crew flew from Varna\nAirport under a deportation procedure. The Libyan Consul arrived in Varna from\nSofia. He took the Captain back to Burgas to file a complaint with the police\nabout the seized tanker. The police, however, refused to accept it. The Captain\nand the Consul returned to Sofia, where the former described the events in a\ncomplaint handed to the Ambassador. He then left for Libya on a flight from\nIstanbul.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bivol was unable to reach the Libyan Consul and the Ambassador\nto confirm this account.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mohammed El Ahrech also confirmed that the statements of the\nCaptain had been notarized in Tripoli and filed as a protest with international\nshipping regulators. The specialized navigation site <em>vesseltracker.com<\/em> has published the GNMTC <a href=\"https:\/\/www.vesseltracker.com\/en\/Ships\/Badr-9356426.html\">reports<\/a>,\nclaiming that the BDDR tanker had been seized by armed men in violation of international\nlaws. \u201cThe vessel\u2019s communications\/AIS had been immediately cut, meaning that\nneither the vessel\u2019s owners nor any legitimate authority can now contact or\ntrack the whereabouts of the ship.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bivol conducted its own inquiry and found that the flag of\nthe BADR ship had been changed after February 25 with a Panamanian registration,\nand after that day, it appears in the AIS system with the name BDIN. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <strong>Marine Traffic<\/strong> system shows that on December 27 the tanker left the Burgas Bay and since then it has been anchored in the Black Sea, apparently outside the 12th mile State border. Maritime specialists suppose that the ship is being repainted and renamed BDIN before being sold.<em><strong>&#8220;<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"625\" src=\"https:\/\/bivol.bg\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/alcor-badr-1024x625.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-44153\" srcset=\"https:\/\/bivol.bg\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/alcor-badr-1024x625.png 1024w, https:\/\/bivol.bg\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/alcor-badr-300x183.png 300w, https:\/\/bivol.bg\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/alcor-badr-768x468.png 768w, https:\/\/bivol.bg\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/alcor-badr-1440x878.png 1440w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>On December 31, the port of Burgas West\u2019s tug ALCOR, headed\ntowards BADR.

According to Andreadaki, the drafts had been used to produce a counterfeit mortgage with her forged signature and seal.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Bivol<\/strong> contacted Ioanna\nAndreadaki by phone and she fully confirmed the information that she had not\nregistered such a mortgage and had filed a complaint with the Greek Prosecution\nOffice for the forgery of her signature and seal. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>She was adamant that criminal proceedings are underway and\nthe graphology test has already proven the forgery of her signature. She\nbelieves that the apostille has been forged as well.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The change of the flag with a Panamanian one has also taken\nplace in Greece, Bivol has learned. The nearest Panamanian consulate which can prepare\nsuch documents is located there.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the Libyans, however, this action is a product\nof forgery as well. They have officially appealed to the Panamanian Maritime\nAdministration. If it withdraws its registration, the ship will remain in a sort\nof &#8220;purgatory&#8221; &#8211; in international waters, without a flag, and unable\nto enter any port.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2> <br \/><strong>Controversial businesses and individuals and former State Security behind Bulgargeomin<\/strong> <\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Bulgargeonmin, the company behind the fake maritime mortgage, includes the companies Tectona, Moran Trade and Moran West.

There is serious evidence that in his youth, during the time of the Communist regime, he had been involved in the trafficking of amphetamines through a German company through the Italian port of Bari.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 1991, the notorious captagone case was launched by the Prosecutor\nGeneral&#8217;s Office. Tsvetan Tsanev was among the 21 defendants, including\npoliticians, directors of State enterprises and State Security agents.\nAccording to the case, the captagone was produced to implement the program for\nthe acquisition of foreign currency, masterminded by the Currency Committee of\nthe Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party. The case was later\nclosed because of important State interests, but the prosecutors had claimed at\nthe time that USD 1 billion a month had been taken out of the country through this\nso-called &#8220;hidden transit&#8221;. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tsanev later became known as a &#8220;credit\nmillionaire&#8221;, who received a loan of BGN 348 million from Mineralbank in\n1992 and never repaid it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tsanev and Henrion are close business associates. Henrion is\nthe manager of the former oil company of Tsanev &#8211; Russpetroleum, investigated\nin the 1990s for deals with Russian aircraft. Today, Russpetroleum is\ncontrolled by the Swiss company Petro Alliance AG38, whose Bulgarian branch is\nrepresented by <strong>Dimitriika Lazarova\nAndreeva<\/strong>.

Either way, it seems\nthat an international scandal is forthcoming because <strong>the actions of PLEA Totko Kolev in fact circumvent the final rule of\nthe Supreme Court and have come as a total surprise to the Libyans<\/strong>. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apart from that, the operation to replace the crew and the means used to do it are shocking and should be investigated by the authorities.
