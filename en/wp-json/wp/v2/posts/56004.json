Konstantinova\u201d Foundation award by the jury in 2016 for its investigations into the <a href=\"https:\/\/bivol.bg\/en?s=Bulgartabac\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bulgartabac<\/a> \u201cmafia\u201d and its connections with the controversial lawmaker and media tycoon <strong>Delyan Peevski<\/strong>. Under pressure from the members of the 2016-jury in the end the Foundation refused to present the award to Bivol. This precedent provoked reactions by Bulgarian and international journalistic organizations. Reporters Without Borders even described the award withdrawal as a &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/rsf.org\/en\/news\/hostile-move-bulgarian-investigative-website-stripped-prize\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">hostile move<\/a>&#8220;.<\/p>\n<p>The following year, Dimitar Stoyanov of Bivol was awarded an incentive prize by the same Foundation, which he refused to accept.<\/p>\n<p><em>&#8220;My humble desire is to clarify the standards for bestowing awards. In 2017, being an author of Bivol is no longer an obstacle to receiving an award from the &#8220;Radostina Konstantinova&#8221; Foundation? If so, why is the Foundation keeping silent about the 2016 award? Such &#8220;flexibility&#8221; in evaluation criteria may be acceptable in judiciary and public administration procedures but we are journalists. I cannot accept such an award, even an incentive one until the ugly precedent of last year is clarified. Otherwise, I would simply legitimize the #WHO model in journalism,<\/em>&#8221; Dimitar wrote then.<\/p>\n<p>The awarding of the prize for investigations stolen from Bivol is a new link in this spiral of cynicism and an example of the tainted Bulgarian media environment.<\/p>\n<p>In this year&#8217;s edition of the \u201cRadostina Konstantinova\u201d awards, <strong>Genka Shikerova<\/strong> won the grand prize for her investigation &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ig4vduX6irE\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">War for Corpses<\/a>&#8220;, which her then-employer Nova TV refused to broadcast, and she even lost her job. <strong>Nikolay Staykov<\/strong> from the Anti-Corruption Fund received an award as well. He has also published investigations based on Bivol&#8217;s findings without citing the original source. The latest is about #DateGate.<\/p>\n<p>The Chairperson of the jury for this year&#8217;s awards was Lyuba Rizova. The jury also included journalists Svetla Petrova, Stoyko Tonev, Valeriy Todorov, Kadrinka Kadrinova, Dobrina Cheshmedzhieva, Mihail Veshim, Ivan Bakalov and prof. Milko Petrov.<\/p>\n<p>It is worth noting that bTV is a leading TV station with a multimillion-dollar budget while the Anti-Corruption Fund is generously funded by America for Bulgaria Foundation. Bivol, on the other hand, is funded by donations from readers and has an incomparably smaller resource than the above-mentioned media. Yet, we strictly adhere to ethical standards and always cite other media if they are the primary source of information in our articles.<\/p>\n<p><em>Headline photo: Teodora Trifonova, bTV<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Journalist Teodora Trifonova of Bulgarian TV channel bTV was awarded a prize by the \u201cRadostina Konstantinova\u201d Foundation for the series &#8220;Houses without Guests&#8221;, which, without exaggeration, was stolen from Bivol&#8217;s&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":55950,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_mo_disable_npp":"","_relevanssi_hide_post":"","_relevanssi_pin_for_all":"","_relevanssi_pin_keywords":"","_relevanssi_unpin_keywords":"","_relevanssi_related_keywords":"","_relevanssi_related_include_ids":"","_relevanssi_related_exclude_ids":"","_relevanssi_related_no_append":"","_relevanssi_related_not_related":"","_relevanssi_related_posts":"","_relevanssi_noindex_reason":"","kia_subtitle":"","spay_email":"","jetpack_publicize_message":"","jetpack_is_tweetstorm":false},"categories":[5544,5806,5550],"tags":[9257,10745,10744,10741,10743,10742],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"https:\/\/bivol.bg\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/trifonova-btv.png","jetpack_publicize_connections":[],"jetpack_sharing_enabled":true,"jetpack_shortlink":"https:\/\/wp.me\/p9hbsr-ezi","jetpack_likes_enabled":true,"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/bivol.bg\/en\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/56004"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/bivol.bg\/en\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/bivol.bg\/en\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/bivol.bg\/en\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/bivol.bg\/en\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=56004"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/bivol.bg\/en\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/56004\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/bivol.bg\/en\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/55950"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/bivol.bg\/en\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=56004"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/bivol.bg\/en\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=56004"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/bivol.bg\/en\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=56004"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
