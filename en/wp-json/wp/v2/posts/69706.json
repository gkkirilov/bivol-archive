These consequences have been triggered by reports by the Civil Association &#8220;Bulgaria United with One Goal&#8221; (BOETS, meaning Fighter in English) and the sites for investigative journalism Bivol.bg and Bird.bg. to the European Commission (EC), the EU anti-fraud office OLAF and European Chief Prosecutor Laura Kovesi. This is what an official letter by the Ministry of Economy to Bivol reveals. It is signed by Iliana Ilieva, Director of the General Directorate &#8220;European Competitiveness Funds&#8221; and Head of the Managing Authority of the Operational Program &#8220;Innovation and Competitiveness&#8221; (OPIC) 2014-2020. Since the biggest violators are long-term partners and subcontractors of the scandalous GP Group, the investigation turns into a kind of sequel of #GPGate.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We remind readers that Bivol sent its inquiries under the Access to Public Information Act (APIA) to a number of ministers and institutions in November 2020. The State National Construction Control (DNSK), Bulgartransgaz, the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Economy did not respond.<\/p>\n<p>Only after repeated inquiries by Bivol to Deputy Prime Minister for EU funds <strong>Tomislav Donchev<\/strong> about the lack answers, Bivol finally received on January 8 the three-page long official position of the Ministry of Economy.<\/p>\n<p><strong>&#8220;Beneficiaries have not repaid their obligations&#8221;<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>It is obvious that BOETS\u2019 reports have led to a number of inspections of the relevant European projects by the European Commission (EC) and the subsequent activation of the oversight bodies in Sofia. Ilieva\u2019s answer reveals that he Managing Authority of the OPIC 2014-2020 has received a letter from the Executive Agency &#8220;Audit of European Union Funds&#8221; (EA OCEC), which recommends corrective measures in connection with the outcome of the inspections.<br \/>\nThe reply recalls that applicants whose project are proposed for funding must present within a 10-day deadline evidence of compliance with the procedure\u2019s requirements by submitting all of the necessary documents.<\/p>\n<p>Ilieva cites item 27.1. A) of the Conditions for application under the procedure, according to which candidates are required to submit a Certificate from the National Revenue Agency (NRA) for lack of obligations, issued no more than six months before the date of the bid\u2019s submission in the form of an original document or a certified copy. This means that some of the companies for which <strong>BOETS, Bivol<\/strong> and <strong>Bird.bg<\/strong> have established existence of obligations to the NRA have received these certificates <strong>in some other way<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>The seven companies have submitted all required documents at the negotiation stage, including NRA certificates for lack of obligations, with which they have met the requirements for a beneficiary, and the managing body of the OPIC has concluded subsidy contracts with them. The companies are Verda 008, TK Dream Build, TK Build, KVP Group, KVP Consult, Amber Oil and Scientific-Technical Union for Construction Consult Engineering.<\/p>\n<p>According to the Ministry of Economy, the EA OCEC has recommended that reports of irregularities committed by these companies be registered to establish the functioning of the projects and the achievement of the set goals. The letter instructs to pay attention to the similarities in the projects established by the Audit Authority, including possible connections between the companies, coincidence in the activity of the financed projects and similarity in the investments, among others.<\/p>\n<p>According to Ilieva, all reports of irregularities have been followed by unannounced on-site inspections and inspections of the companies\u2019 paperwork.<\/p>\n<p>The results of these inspections have been listed in reports to the Head of the Managing Authority of the OPIC and have ended with registration of irregularities and decisions for financial corrections of 100% of the amount of the granted EU funds. <\/p>\n<p>Judging by Iliana Ilieva&#8217;s letter to Bivol, the case has also reached the Sofia City Prosecutor as early as September 2020, a few weeks before the first actions of BOETS on the TurkStream 2 construction sites in October 2020. This fact makes us doubt that the authorities\u2019 reports to the prosecution have been backdated.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Ilieva also admits that the millions of EU funds have not yet been even partially recovered because the companies obviously do not plan to return them and had challenged the 100% correction decision with complaints to the Sofia City Administrative Court.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The initiated legal proceedings are still ongoing, Ilieva writes.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Companies associated with GP Group win millions in government contracts<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Checks in the Commercial Register, in the search engines of Bivol and Bird.bg and in the Information System for Management and Monitoring of EU Funds in Bulgaria (UMIS) revealed that some of the partners in the seven companies are not only subcontractors in numerous projects of the scandalous GP Group but also partners in a number of other companies that benefit from government procurement.<\/p>\n<p>Moreover, the management of the seven companies is intertwined so that its owners are partners in these or other companies found on the sites of TurkStream 2 and in other large-scale national or European projects in the country. And this means an automatic additional increase in the cost of projects for Bulgarian and European taxpayers, as well as huge VAT turnovers, even for the smallest-scale construction activities.<\/p>\n<p>The construction companies <strong>TK DREAM BUILD<\/strong> and <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/bird.bg\/tr?q=131267170\">TK BUILD<\/a><\/strong> have secured about BGN 2 million in EU funding.

Dream Build is a beneficiary of projects for a total value of BGN 2.1 million under the Program &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/bird.bg\/isun2020\/?v=view&#038;id=56565\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Competitiveness through energy efficiency<\/a>&#8220;.<\/p>\n<p>The person <strong>Stoyko Lyubomirov Zahariev<\/strong> is registered as a partner in two other construction companies from the seven investigated in the case &#8211; <strong>Scientific-Technical Union for Construction Consult Engineering<\/strong> and <strong>Amber Oil<\/strong>.

The reported activity under the European project includes acquisition of machinery, facilities and equipment, representing tangible fixed assets necessary for the implementation of Measure 1 &#8220;Delivery, installation and commissioning of a modular jaw crusher&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>All three companies (except Scientific-Technical Union for Construction Consult Engineering) with their common partner <strong>Stoyko Zahariev<\/strong> are obviously default clients of the \u201cbad apple\u201d bank <strong>International Asset Bank<\/strong>, which is associated with one of the leaders of organized crime in Bulgaria <strong>Mladen \u201cMadzo\u201d Mihalev<\/strong>.

Its brand new construction machines were photographed by BOETS and Bulphoto at construction sites in the village of Makresh.

According to the documentation, the investments will be used to purchase assets representing a technological line for expanding the production of factions. A system for monitoring energy consumption will be built as a component of the technological line to reduce energy consumption.<\/p>\n<p>Otherwise, the company <strong>Verda 008<\/strong> is quite modest, according to entries in the Commercial Register and can hardly win and successfully manage a project for about BGN 1 million. The company was incorporated on May 10, 2008. Its headquarters are listed in Bulgaria\u2019s western city of Pernik. The initial capital amounts to only BGN 5,000, which hardly presupposes the realization of projects worth millions.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Kaloyan Teodosiev<\/strong> is the owner of both <strong>Energogroup<\/strong> and the well-known in the construction industry <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/bird.bg\/tr\/?v=view&#038;guid=121115366\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Interprom<\/a><\/strong>.

It shared another BGN 8.4 million for the water supply network in the town of Kostinbrod with the infamous GP Group. The wastewater treatment plant in Kostinbrod was built for BGN 10.2 million and a station for wastewater treatment in the town of Knezha brought the company another BGN 8 million. The water cycle of Panagyurishte built by Interprom and GP Group was for BGN 12.8 million. <\/p>\n<p>Regional media <a href=\"http:\/\/pirinsko.com\/izgoneniqt-ot-s-logodaj-investitor-k-teodosiev-mesti-planovete-si-za-kariera-v-bobovdolsko-58590.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Pirinsko<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/4vlast-bg.com\/archives\/304911\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Fourth Estate<\/a> mention that investor Kaloyan Teodosiev\u2019s \u201ccareer\u201d in the village of Logodazh near the southwestern city of Blagoevgrad was \u201cstopped in court by the mayors of Logodazh, Plamen Chervenkov, of Selishte, Blagoy Panayotov, and of Zelen Dol, Angel Mladenov.
