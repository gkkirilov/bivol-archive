These are Imoti (Property) Management Stoletov and General Stoletov Property. Initially, Sofia Central Ltd. had been the property of <strong>MS-Consult 2004, in which Vaklin and Karkovski are co-owners<\/strong>. Subsequently, MS-Consult 2004 sold shares to Va\u043alin, who remained the manager of the company throughout its existence.<\/p>\n<p>After acquiring the plots, K\u0430rkovski and Vaklin&#8217;s companies have been transferred to offshore companies. MS Consult 2010 becomes the property of the Seychelles offshore Transview Holding Limited, and Miroslav Chergarov has been appointed as manager. Sofia Central has sold Property Management Stoletov and General Stoletov Property to another Seychelles offshore &#8211; Tasaki Holdings Limited.<\/p>\n<p>This concealment of ownership appears to be related to the cash flows required to complete the construction work. Until then, they had come from MS-Consult 2004, where the partnership of Vaklin and Karkovski is evident.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Friendly businessman-prosecutor relations<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Until November 9, 2012, Sofia Central of Alexander Vaklin had been a partner in the company M Consult 95. Then Vaklin&#8217;s company sold its shares for BGN 189,500 to MAV Group, whose ultimate owner is Karkovski.<br \/>\nA month later, on December 14, 2013, the M Consult 95 of the &#8220;friend&#8221; Mario Karkovski and Detelina Hancheva founded the company OTEA Ltd, in which they still have shares.<\/p>\n<p>According to an investigation by the site <a href=\"https:\/\/frognews.bg\/novini\/prokuraturata-potvardi-priaka-vrazka-geshev-ortaka-vaklin-dokumenti.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>Frognews<\/em><\/a>, in 2014, Detelina Hancheva paid only BGN 465 (EUR 234) per square meter for an apartment of about 86 square meters in the then still under construction residential building on 8, \u201cGeneral Nikolay Stoletov\u201d boulevard. We repeat &#8211; Alexander Vaklin\u2019s company was the one that built the property. Property prices in the area at that time ranged between EUR 800 and EUR 900 per square meter.<\/p>\n<p>A notary public has registered the deal at a price even below the tax assessment, but the Prosecutor\u2019s Office sees no problem in this, demonstrating in advance what the results of the probes into all of the #ApartmentGate scandals with cheap property acquired by politicians will be. Current Prosecutor General Sotir Tsatsarov is also among the officials with cheap properties. Bivol recently revealed that he had acquired a villa in the Rhodope Mountains for half the price.<\/p>\n<p>Nevertheless, the Supreme Judicial Council must and should examine the very fact that Ivan Geshev&#8217;s family has benefited from an investment project with the direct involvement of Alexander Vaklin &#8211; the main witness in the scandalous legal case against former Sofia district mayor <a href=\"https:\/\/bivol.bg\/en\/authorities-provide-cover-up-for-prosecutor-generals-villa.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Desislava Ivancheva<\/a>. Moreover, Geshev was extremely active in this same case. \u201cBoets\u201d has already announced it is preparing a complaint.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Another partner is associated with the destroyed tobacco warehouses in Plovdiv<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Ivan Geshev&#8217;s friend Mario Karkovski and the &#8220;witness&#8221; Alexander Vaklin are also partners with <strong>Nayden Marinov Kolev<\/strong> through their companies, and the three run jointly the company <a href=\"https:\/\/tr.bivol.bg\/view.php?guid=200024918\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sofia Consult &#8211; B Ltd<\/a>. Their joint business venture dates from 2008.<\/p>\n<p>On his part, Nayden Kolev has business ties with the company that demolished the historic and emblematic old tobacco warehouses in the heart of the second largest city of Plovdiv. The prosecutions charged for the demolition Georgi Branekov and Alexnder Nicolic from the management of the company PJ Trade, keeper of the emblematic \u201cOrient Tobacco\u201d building. Kolev, Branekov, and Nikolic are co-owners in the company PJ Logistics, while a relative of Nayden Kolev is among the shareholders of PJ Trade.<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>Clarification:<\/strong> This article was updated on August 11, 2019.
