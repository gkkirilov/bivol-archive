We had the impression that we are being contacted for diplomatic intervention because, obviously, Mr Radev is a person with diplomatic status, as I understand he is a Member of the European Parliament, and we believed that this was an official initiative by the Bulgarian state to solve the problem. Unfortunately, this was not the case, because when we met, our side talked about the violations by the Bulgarian administration, which are being examined in the Bulgarian court, and we were surprised that they talked about a settlement.<\/em>&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Our editorial office is keeping the full recording of the conversation with Mr. Ellahresh.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Consultation reeking of racket<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>The settlement was to happen through a consultancy contract with a law office close to Radev for the impressive amount of EUR 4.5 million, of which EUR 1.5 million in a non-refundable prepayment, regardless of the outcome of the mediation.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;<em>They suggested, through <strong>Maya Andreeva<\/strong>, a consultancy agreement, according to which GNMTC has to pay EUR 4.5 million to have the ship released. Part of the amount \u2013 EUR 1.5 million &#8211; would be non-refundable under any circumstances, whether the mediation is successful or fails, and the other part of this amount was supposed to be paid after the ship is released. Of course, such a consultancy contract for EUR 1.5 million is absurd, unreal, and we rejected the offer entirely and immediately informed Maya Andreeva via an official email. She is the person who works closely with Mr. Radev; I think she is his partner. As far as I understand, she is closely connected with the Bulgarian government in the transport sector.<\/em>&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Asked again whether one of the Bulgarian visitors had been indeed <strong>Dimitar Borisov<\/strong>, one of the owners of the waste management company Titan, and co-owner of the company Bulgargeomin, claiming the ownership of the tanker, Ellahresh confirmed the following:<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;<em>Dimitar Borisov is the person who organized this whole scheme. He was sitting opposite us along with Gigov and Radev as a guarantee that the release would happen<\/em>.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>However, the Libyans are firm that they would not submit to any form of ransom or racketeering to get back their illegally seized property and will seek their rights in court to the very end. The Libyan company is indeed very active in Bulgarian courts and international institutions, especially since the tanker was practically hijacked in Bulgarian territorial waters.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Radev: Your facts are false, but I have no problem to be a consultant<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Asked via email about the occurrence and his actions, as well as a possible conflict with his functions as an MEP, Emil Radev replied:<\/p>\n<p><em>&#8220;What you claim is not true. I would like to inform you that for over 20 years I have practiced law as my profession. Practicing law is authorized for both Members of the Bulgarian Parliament and Members of the European Parliament and does not constitute a conflict of interest with parliamentary activity.&#8221;<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Bivol sent additional specific questions: what is not true in the factuality, who had financed the trip to Libya, had Radev received a fee, and if he had not received a fee what had motivated him to join Gigov and Borisov in this mediation procedure. We did not receive an answer by the publication of this article.<\/p>\n<p>It is a fact that the MEP combines his work as a lawyer at the Bar Association in the Black Sea city of Varna with his lawmaking activities. He is an expert in commercial, financial, administrative, international, private and civil law, according to his Wikipedia page, which presents him in a good light and with praiseworthy credentials. Emil Radev has declared to the European Parliament income from law practice, as well as from the company &#8220;Invest consulting 2002&#8221;, whose managers are his relatives.<\/p>\n<p>However, law practice to obtain benefits through an openly criminal scheme hardly fits the high moral and ethical standards that Members of the European Parliament should hold dear. Moreover, other officials, such as Maya Andreeva, are involved, while the reputation of the other intermediaries Nikolai Gigov and Dimitar Borisov is rather shady.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>The \u201cpreferential\u201d MEP<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>In the last European Parliament elections, Emil Radev from GERB had a hard time being re-elected, although whole villages far away from his native Varna voted preferentially for him, as the analysis of the election results shows.

Nevertheless, GERB&#8217;s inner reshuffles with other MEP candidates such as Mariya Gabriel and Lilyana Pavlova, who declined becoming MEPs, still propelled him to the European Parliament.<\/p>\n<p>Once in there, Radev succeeded in taking the important post of Deputy Chair of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE). In his previous term, he was a member of the Committee on Legal Affairs.<\/p>\n<p>In the military, Emil Radev had served in the same secret naval unit &#8220;Tihina&#8221; as the two bosses of the Varna-based TIM group &#8211; Ivo Kamenov and Marin Mitev.

This happened after Bivol published documents proving the past connection of the Prime Minister with an illegal cigarette factory in Kraymorie on the Black Sea coast. The anti-mafia police discovered and attacked the factory in 1995. Subsequently, the legal case reached a dead end, and Borisov and his partner Rumen \u201cThe Pasha\u201d Nikolov sold the company &#8220;Teo International&#8221; to Ivo Kamenov from TIM.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>A contract with a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Radev, a mediator with State Security ties, a friend of Borisov<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>The name of <strong>Maya Andreeva<\/strong>, who, according to the Libyan side, had sent the written offer discussed at the meeting, emerged years ago in a scandal related to Radev. In 2011, she was appointed member of the Central Electoral Commission (CEC) from the GERB quota. It became clear at that time that Andreeva shared an office with the MP from GERB, Emil Radev, but he denied having anything to do with her.<\/p>\n<p>Andreeva&#8217;s career advancement continued in 2017 when she became a member of the Board of Directors of Sofia Airport, in which she still holds a seat.

He recently put these ties to use as the local agent for EADS, helping the European consortium win the MoD&#8217;s competition to supply the Bulgarian military with Eurocopter helicopters.

This is a EUR-9 million maritime mortgage issued in Athens, bearing the signature and the seal of Greek notary Ioanna Andreadaki. However, Andreadaki insists that her signature and seal are forged. She has filed a complaint with the Greek Prosecutor\u2019s Office whose investigation is ongoing.<\/p>\n<p>When the scandal turned international, the Bulgarian State institutions expressed tacit support for the pirates, distancing themselves from the case, declaring the criminal scheme a &#8220;private legal&#8221; dispute, and accepting a fake mortgage as proof.<\/p>\n<p>The Bulgarian Prosecutor&#8217;s Office had also known about the fake mortgage and had launched an investigation at the beginning of 2018 on a complaint by the Libyan side. However, this fact became public only after Greek police arrested agent Georgios Lapas, who had brought the representative of Bulgargeomin Assen Kavdansky to the notary in Athens.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Thus, instead of putting an end to an obviously criminal story, the Prosecutor&#8217;s Office had been idle, while MEP Radev and arms dealer Gigov had tried to take advantage of the situation through consultancy services.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Although the judicial saga with the tanker continues, there is already a clear result of the criminal activities of the group, whose consultant is Emil Radev \u2013 tarnishing Bulgaria\u2019s image abroad. The site of the US Office of Naval Intelligence reports the capture of BADR in Bulgaria as a pirate attack.<\/p>\n<p><em>Atanas Tchobanov, Assen Yordanov<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>At the beginning of August 2018, Bulgarian MEP Emil Radev (ruling party Citizens of European Development of Bulgaria, GERB\/European People\u2019s Party, EPP), together with arms dealer Nikolai Gigov and Dimitar&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":48014,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":true,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_mo_disable_npp":"","_relevanssi_hide_post":"","_relevanssi_pin_for_all":"","_relevanssi_pin_keywords":"","_relevanssi_unpin_keywords":"","_relevanssi_related_keywords":"","_relevanssi_related_include_ids":"","_relevanssi_related_exclude_ids":"","_relevanssi_related_no_append":"","_relevanssi_related_not_related":"","_relevanssi_related_posts":"","_relevanssi_noindex_reason":"","kia_subtitle":"","spay_email":"","jetpack_publicize_message":"","jetpack_is_tweetstorm":false},"categories":[5542,5806],"tags":[8973,9399,9591,8097,5147,9592,5966],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"https:\/\/bivol.bg\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/badr-radev-gigov-titan.jpeg","jetpack_publicize_connections":[],"jetpack_sharing_enabled":true,"jetpack_shortlink":"https:\/\/wp.me\/p9hbsr-cuK","jetpack_likes_enabled":true,"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/bivol.bg\/en\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/48034"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/bivol.bg\/en\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/bivol.bg\/en\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/bivol.bg\/en\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/bivol.bg\/en\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=48034"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/bivol.bg\/en\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/48034\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/bivol.bg\/en\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/48014"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/bivol.bg\/en\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=48034"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/bivol.bg\/en\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=48034"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/bivol.bg\/en\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=48034"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
