The case, however, made the headlines only after the US Ambassador to Bulgaria Eric Rubin had a meeting with Prime Minister Boyko Borisov, Prosecutor General, Sotir Tsatsarov and the head of Bulgarian intelligence to inform them that the Venezuelan cash flow through a Bulgarian bank had been confirmed by the US financial intelligence.<\/p>\n<p>Tsatsarov, who spoke to the press after the meeting with the US Ambassador, didn&#8217;t name the bank and only mentioned the initials of the account holder as Ts.

Borisov then said that this somewhat fabled backstage group was behind the \u201cBuddha\u201d revelation. It includes former leaders of the Communist and early post-Communist state and senior officers from the Communist regime\u2019s special services \u2013 the State Security (DS) known as the &#8220;Bulgarian KGB&#8221;. Borisov\u2019s statement showed that he had been close to this circle, which brings together figures such as <strong>Victor Vulkov<\/strong>, a former Foreign Minister in the 1990\u2019s (DS agent with the codename Pencho), <strong>Maxim Dimov<\/strong> \u2013 former lawmaker from the Movement for Rights and Freedoms (DPS), the party largely representing Bulgaria\u2019s Muslim minority and later a treasurer of the National Movement for Stability and Prosperity (<strong>NDSV<\/strong>) of former Tsar and Prime Minister, Simeon Saxe-Coburg, <strong>Dimitar Sabev<\/strong> (DS agent with the codename Assen), <strong>General Dimo Krastinov<\/strong>, <strong>Ivan Sazdov<\/strong> &#8211; the head of the tennis club in Bankya, who \u201crose to fame\u201d alongside the &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/bivol.bg\/en\/yaneva-gate-bulgarian-prime-minister-bought-for-a-mistress-a-house-in-barcelona-for-1-5-million-euro.html\">House in Barcelona<\/a>&#8220;, <strong>Evstati Gyurov<\/strong> (a former full-time DS officer), among others. General <strong>Chavdar Chernev<\/strong>, who in the early 1990s headed the Sofia Policed Directorate, is considered to have been their leader. He is also \u201ccredited\u201d with arming the first thug brigades in Bulgaria.<\/p>\n<p>The name of the group comes from the &#8220;White House&#8221; restaurant in the Sofia suburb of Bankya where the gatherings had been held. Part of its members relocated later to restaurant \u201cMonterey,\u201d where a new group had been formed, led by former DS general, <strong>Lyuben Gotsev<\/strong>. He is credited with the founding of the so-called &#8220;Generals\u2019 Movement&#8221; in the mid-1990s, which brought together most of the members of informal &#8220;generals\u2019&#8221; circles such as \u201cBankya\u201d and \u201cMonterey\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>In fact, these backstage groups have been consistently ruling the country throughout the Transition Period after the fall of the Communist regime, and all active political or economic players are their projects and puppets, according to data and analyses of informed intelligence sources. It is no secret that behind the \u201cchild prodigy\u201d Delyan Peevski&#8217;s facade and his unexplainable rise to political and business stardom, lurks the long hand of high-ranking former DS officers.<\/p>\n<p>These individuals have had and some still have joint businesses through the companies \u201cInterbulpred\u201d, \u201cSofia Delta Ltd.\u201d, \u201cRubin Tours\u201d and \u201cElmaz 24\u201d.

Their families are from southern border town of Svilengrad, where Dimitar Sabev and Nedyalkov&#8217;s mother &#8211; Sofka Dimitrova \u2013 own a family home together. It is located on 13 \u201cGeneral Strukov\u201d Street. This is also evident from the Property Register, where Nedyalkov had been registered together with his mother in 2014. In 2002, Dimitar Sabev had sold the second floor of the house to Nedyalko Nedyalkov&#8217;s sister Maria.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>The intersection point &#8211; Russian oil business<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Tsvetan Tsanev is not among the &#8220;Bankya Circle&#8221; members, but his business interests intersect with <strong>Dimitar Sabev<\/strong> and <strong>Maxim Dimov<\/strong>.

He was a shareholder in the investment brokerage company &#8220;Hedger&#8221; of Maxim Dimov and General Dimo Krastinov and a partner of Dimov in several other companies including \u201cMakKap\u201d and \u201cSofia Wind Park\u201d.

The Swiss Prosecutor&#8217;s Office has also launched an investigation into \u201cArvex\u201d, which outcome remains unknown. Meanwhile \u201cArvex\u201d has been liquidated.

The Bank claims that all transfers have passed through third banks and have been screened according to international anti-money laundering rules.<\/p>\n<p>The statement of Prosecutor General Sotir Tsatsarov was also along these lines as he said that the Bank had not been aware of what had been going on.<\/p>\n<p>However, with all these connections, it is quite obvious that there is no way Investbank had not known about Tsanev&#8217;s account and the significant for local standards amounts that had transited through it. After all, one of the Bank\u2019s main shareholders, al-Shanfari, is undoubtedly linked to the business of lawyer Tsvetan Tsanev through Assen Kavdansky and Dimitriika Lazarova.<\/p>\n<p>Furthermore, it is worth recalling that the genesis of Investbank is closely related to the circle around General Lyuben Gotsev, who joined the Supervisory Board of the International Orthodox Bank of St. Nicholas before it was renamed to Neftinvestbank and finally to Investbank.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1528\" height=\"350\" class=\"wp-image-45577\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/bivol.bg\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/sveti-nikola.png?fit=1024%2C235&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/bivol.bg\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/sveti-nikola.png 1528w, https:\/\/bivol.bg\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/sveti-nikola-300x69.png 300w, https:\/\/bivol.bg\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/sveti-nikola-768x176.png 768w, https:\/\/bivol.bg\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/sveti-nikola-1024x235.png 1024w, https:\/\/bivol.bg\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/sveti-nikola-1170x268.png 1170w, https:\/\/bivol.bg\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/sveti-nikola-585x134.png 585w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1528px) 100vw, 1528px\" \/><\/figure>\n<p>Furthermore, Investbank is described by former US Ambassador to Bulgaria John Beyrle in a\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/wikileaks.org\/plusd\/cables\/06SOFIA1652_a.html\">classified diplomatic cable<\/a>\u00a0from 2006 that leaked to WikiLeaks as one of the \u201cbad apples\u201d Bulgarian banks \u201cwhose practices are repeatedly cited as questionable or shady, funneling money for known criminals in money laundering schemes and involved in connected lending\u201d.\u00a0<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Questions with and without answers<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>All of the above raises many questions and the first one is how is it possible that a Deputy Director of DANS has family and business relations with the Russian oil business, with which Tsvetan Tsanev is also closely associated?<\/p>\n<p>According to the requirements of the newly adopted by Parliament Act on Measures for Preventing Money Laundering and its Rules of Procedure, each Bulgarian bank is mandated to train its employees in due time and to provide information to the Financial Intelligence Unit of DANS on any financial operation that causes even the slightest suspicion of money laundering, and especially on those from abroad and especially on those from risky areas, such as Latin America.<\/p>\n<p>What is the reason why the DANS totally missed the existence of the &#8220;Venezuelan Laundromat&#8221; at Investbank? Why had the DANS and Prosecutor Sotir Tsatsarov waited for the US authorities\u2019 signal to undertake some actions? Why did Tsatsarov lie on live TV that the Bank had nothing to do with the funneling of Venezuelan money and had not known what had been going on? Why is the name of lawyer Tsvetan Tsanev remaining a taboo for all institutions?<\/p>\n<p>Bivol sent questions to the DANS via e-mail. We asked about Nedyalko Nedyalkov&#8217;s exact kinship with Dimitar Sabev and whether Nedyalkov had worked in companies controlled by Sabev or Maxim Dimov. We also asked whether the DANS leadership has deliberated whether these family and business ties of Nedyalkov could influence the work of the Agency on the prevention and interception of money laundering. We did not receive an answer.<\/p>\n<p>However, we received a response from the government press office after we asked Prime Minister Borisov, who is in charge of DANS, how would he assess the fact that a Deputy Director of the Agency has ties with the &#8220;Bankya Circle&#8221;, Tsanev and a Russian oil company. It reads:<\/p>\n<p><em>\u201cPrime Minister Boyko Borisov will instruct the Director of the National Security Agency Dimitar Georgiev to probe your claims regarding his deputy.\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n<p>However, there is also no answer to the questions sent to Investbank. We were unable to contact Tsvetan Tsanev at the available e-mail addresses and phone numbers of the companies in which he participates. Of course, their right of reply is standing.<\/p>\n<p>The reason for such discretion is probably the remarcable list of Tsanev&#8217;s merits &#8211; from captagone trafficker, through train cars and airplanes affairs, a partnership with a boss of Cosa Nostra in a bloody diamond business, to the very recent pirate raid against the tanker BADR and his role in the \u201cVenezuelan Laundromat\u201d \u2013 an impressive biography associated with the DS and the backstage rule.<\/p>\n<p>Nevertheless, perhaps the most important goal is to keep secret the connection between Tsvetan Tsanev, Russian oil and individuals from the &#8220;Bankya Circle&#8221;. This, however, can no longer be ignored. The first checks that we made into the Russian owners, together with colleagues of renowned international publications, reveal even more alarming facts about which you will read in the next part of our investigation.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><em>To be continued<\/em><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Attorney Tsvetan Tsanev, to whose name the account at Investbank has been registered, the same account which has been used to funnel tens of millions of Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela, S.A.,&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":45613,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_mo_disable_npp":"","_relevanssi_hide_post":"","_relevanssi_pin_for_all":"","_relevanssi_pin_keywords":"","_relevanssi_unpin_keywords":"","_relevanssi_related_keywords":"","_relevanssi_related_include_ids":"","_relevanssi_related_exclude_ids":"","_relevanssi_related_no_append":"","_relevanssi_related_not_related":"","_relevanssi_related_posts":"","_relevanssi_noindex_reason":"","kia_subtitle":"","spay_email":"","jetpack_publicize_message":"","jetpack_is_tweetstorm":false},"categories":[5542,5806],"tags":[9145,9144,9146,9148,9149,5126,5136,5107,9150,9151,9152,9135,9147],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"https:\/\/bivol.bg\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/gocev-nedyalko.png","jetpack_publicize_connections":[],"jetpack_sharing_enabled":true,"jetpack_shortlink":"https:\/\/wp.me\/p9hbsr-bRZ","jetpack_likes_enabled":true,"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/bivol.bg\/en\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/45631"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/bivol.bg\/en\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/bivol.bg\/en\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/bivol.bg\/en\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/bivol.bg\/en\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=45631"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/bivol.bg\/en\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/45631\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/bivol.bg\/en\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/45613"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/bivol.bg\/en\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=45631"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/bivol.bg\/en\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=45631"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/bivol.bg\/en\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=45631"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
