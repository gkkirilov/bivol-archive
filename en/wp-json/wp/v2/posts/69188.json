SPIEGEL has approached both ministries for comment and both have denied distributing substandard masks. It turned out that officials were not aware that the DEKRA seals had been forged.<\/p>\n<p>The Bulgarian experience with these masks is even more outrageous, as they were advertised as medical masks and this is written in the contract for their purchase, which Bivol has in its possession. However, the masks delivered by aircraft were not medical, according to the GB19083-2010 standard \/see <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ryzur.com.cn\/index.php?m=content&#038;c=index&#038;a=lists&#038;catid=483\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">here<\/a>\/, but ordinary disposable particulate respirator masks, according to the GB2626 standard \/see <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ryzur.com.cn\/index.php?m=content&#038;c=index&#038;a=lists&#038;catid=486\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">here<\/a>\/, not suitable for use by healthcare professionals.<\/p>\n<p>The masks ordered by Bulgaria also had fake stamps from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European quality CE.
