Anguelov is the closest and most trusted lawyer of media mogul and controversial lawmaker from the party Movement for Rights and Freedoms (DPS),\u00a0<strong>Delyan Peevski,<\/strong> and the son of a powerful officer from the sinister &#8220;Bulgarian KGB&#8221; &#8211;  the Communist regime\u2019s secret services \u2013 the State Security (&#8220;Darzhavna Sigurnost&#8221; or DS).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Viafot&#8221;\nis the owner of the Bulgarian company &#8220;Viafot Investment Bulgaria&#8221;,\nwhich in the last two years had been attempting a takeover of the weapons\nfactory &#8220;Dunarit&#8221; in the Bulgarian Danube city of Russe with the\nsupport of all State institutions. The owner of &#8220;Dunarit&#8221; Emiliyan\nGebrev complained in a TV interview that after he had agreed to become part of\nthe factory\u2019s ownership, he had been attacked by the repressive machine of the\nProsecutor&#8217;s Office and the National Revenue Agency. There had been even a\nphysical assault of the businessman and his son.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cDunarit\u201d is associated with the former majority shareholder\nand owner of the collapsed Corporate Commercial Bank (CCB) <strong>Tsvetan Vassilev<\/strong> and \u201cViafot\u201d with <strong>Delyan Peevski<\/strong>. The two were close until 2014, when a falling-out\nbetween them led to the Bank\u2019s collapse. The profitable factory remained under\nVassilev\u2019s control, and the takeover attempt is a logical continuation of the\nwar for the CCB\u2019s inheritance, in which the companies associated with Peevski\nenjoy the support of the State.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>MP Delyan Peevski is considered to be the visible symbol and\nemanation of the &#8220;Deep State&#8221; in Bulgaria &#8211; as a front of former State\nSecurity officers and agents, close to the <strong>DPS<\/strong>\nparty and to the <strong>Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP)<\/strong>,&nbsp;who are the backstage\nmasterminds of the political processes and who dominate huge businesses. The\nevents associated with Peevski are characterized by brutality and blatant\nneglect of laws and rules.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Peevski is often called a &#8220;child prodigy&#8221; for\nhaving had an unexplained stellar career and business since 2001. At that time\nhe rose on the political horizon as a young man with high school education who\nsuddenly became the Director of the Port of Varna, followed by the post of\npolitical secretary to the Minister of Transport, followed by a career as\nmagistrate, lawmaker and deputy minister without the necessary qualifications\nand biography. Since 2007, after having received unrestricted financing from\nthe CCB and personally by Tsvetan Vassilev, Delyan Peevski is the owner,\ncontroller and monopolist of the media market in Bulgaria.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2013, when the BSP came to power and formed a government\nled by Prime Minister, Plamen Oresharski, Peevski was elected Head of the\nNational Security Agency (DANS) in an extremely outrageous manner, which\nsparked massive protest rallies that led to his resignation and to the\nresignation of Oresharski\u2019s government. Called by Spiegel magazine the &#8220;Iceberg\nof Corruption&#8221; in Bulgaria, Delyan Peevski has been continuously expanding\nhis business empire and political influence over the years, regardless of the\npolitical situation. His mentors are the masterminds of the political and\nsocial model known as <strong>#WHO<\/strong>, a model creating\nthe lasting feeling in Bulgaria that <strong>not\nthe particular Prime Minister, but namely # WHO runs and controls everything in\nthe country<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>&#8220;I am not\nPeevski&#8217;s lawyer&#8221;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Angelov argued publicly in 2015 that he was not Peevski\u2019s\nlawyer and knew him only &#8220;for three-four years&#8221;. Questions about his\nrelationship with Peevski were asked in connection with Angelov joining the\nmanagement of the football club &#8220;Levski&#8221;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alexander Angelov is a member of the boards of directors and\nrepresents key enterprises from the business empire of Peevski and of Peevski\u2019s\nmother, Irena Krasteva, such as the \u201cRodina\u201d Publishing House, the \u201cUnited\nBulgarian Newspapers\u201d, the newspaper <em>Standart<\/em>\nand others.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For many years, Delyan Peevski did not declare any property, except for an old \u201cOpel\u201d automobile, despite numerous indirect evidence that he controls a massive business. He began to shed light on his property only after 2016, and at the moment he is the wealthiest lawmaker in the Bulgarian Parliament, where he very rarely shows up. Nevertheless, the declared property is still the tip of the iceberg of Peevski\u2019s assets, as evidenced by a <a href=\"https:\/\/bivol.bg\/en\/how-much-does-peevski-weigh-bgn-1-5-billion.html\">leaked portfolio<\/a> of the associated with him company \u201cTGI Middle East\u201d, registered in Dubai.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the key assets associated with Peevski is the\nBulgarian cigarette holding and tobacco manufacturer \u201cBulgartabac\u201d, privatized\nin 2011.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Tsvetan Vassilev&#8217;s public statements, Alexander\nAngelov is the person who had compiled and had sent to Vassilev\u2019s email address\n<a href=\"https:\/\/bivol.bg\/en\/peevski-is-leaving-bulgartabac-is-leaving-partnership-with-bulgarias-powerful-people-remains.html\">the\nscheme for the privatization of \u201cBulgartabac\u201d<\/a>. The scheme had also included\nthe names of three offshore companies that have had to set aside a 10%\ncommission for Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borisov, his friend Alexander\nStaliysky and Ahmed Dogan, the former leader of the DPS and the Movement\u2019s\nLifetime Honorary Chairman, as Vassilev claims. However, a check by Bivol\nrevealed that the offshores had been closed not long after the privatization\ndeal.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vassilev further claims that Angelov has brought to him a list of companies and assets that\nPeevski had wanted to obtain from him in the midst of their conflict, just\nbefore the CCB\u2019s bankruptcy: &#8220;This list came from <em>Peevski<\/em>, it was brought by his lawyer <em>Alexander Angelov<\/em>. <em>This is a\npure racket<\/em>,&#8221; Vassilev said in a TV interview.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;<em>Let&#8217;s sit down\ntogether, the four us &#8211; me, Peevski, Alexander Angelov and Bisser Lazov and see\nwho is lying,<\/em>&#8221; the banker suggested, as the TV host remarked that the\nlist was just a piece of paper.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Children of State Security<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;In 2009, Angelov\ntogether with attorney <strong>Geno Andreev<\/strong>\ncreated the consultancy company &#8220;Aviora Consult&#8221;. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><div id=\"attachment_44698\" style=\"width: 439px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a rel=\"attachment wp-att-44698\" href=\"https:\/\/bivol.bg\/en\/panama-papers-viafot.html\/screen-shot-2019-01-17-at-15-43-13\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-44698\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"429\" height=\"289\" scale=\"0\" class=\" wp-image-44698\" src=\"https:\/\/bivol.bg\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/Screen-Shot-2019-01-17-at-15.43.13.png\" data-rel=\"penci-gallery-image-content\"  alt=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/bivol.bg\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/Screen-Shot-2019-01-17-at-15.43.13.png 691w, https:\/\/bivol.bg\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/Screen-Shot-2019-01-17-at-15.43.13-300x202.png 300w, https:\/\/bivol.bg\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/Screen-Shot-2019-01-17-at-15.43.13-585x394.png 585w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 429px) 100vw, 429px\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-44698\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Att.

He is remembered as one of the most successful DS recruiters, as some of his agents &#8220;grew&#8221; to become lawmakers and journalists in the transition period after the fall of the Communist regime. In 1990, he was appointed Deputy Director of the <strong>National Service for the Protection of the Constitution<\/strong>. It is the State Security\u2019s heir by ideology and staff.

In 1994, <strong>during the term of the Socialist government of Prime Minister Zhan Videnov, Paraskevov was appointed<\/strong> <strong>Deputy Interior Minister<\/strong> in charge of National Security, including the-then National Service for Combatting Organized Crime (NSBOP).

It turned out that for many years the\nlaw office had been hiding the real owners of offshore companies involved in\nmoney laundering and concealing the wealth of political figures. Therefore,\nafter the scandal, \u201cMossak &amp; Fonseca\u201d launched an inventory of all\ncompanies for which the registers lack data about the ultimate beneficiaries.\nIn December 2016, information on the owner of \u201cViafot\u201d had been requested via\nemail.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The declaration sent to the Panamanian office and signed by Alexander Angelov states that the company does not carry out any activities and the source of wealth is listed as loans from the beneficial owner, Angelov himself. The countries where the company operates are not designated. Copies of Angelov\u2019s passport and ID card are attached to the declaration. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, Angelov\u2019s declaration does not correspond to the\nfactual situation. &#8220;Viafot&#8221; is operating in Bulgaria and for a lot of\nmoney. As the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ktbfiles.com\/ktb-top100\/ktb-top100-dunarit-ad\/\">KTBFiles<\/a> (CCB\nFiles) project writes, in March 2016 &#8220;Viafot Investment Bulgaria&#8221;\nbought from Italian businessman Edoardo Miroglio through a transfer (cession),\nthe receivables of his company \u201cE. Miroglio\u201d from \u201cDunarit\u201d. The preliminary cession\nagreement is dated December 4, 2015.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the time when the Italian businessman owned assets of \u201cTechnomarket\u201d\nand \u201cDunarit\u201d the &#8220;unfortunate incidents&#8221; in his life somehow got\nmore frequent. Miroglio was in a severe car crash in southern Bulgaria in which\ntwo of the people travelling with him were killed \u2013 two women on the backseat\nwithout seatbelts. The crash happened in broad daylight and in good weather and\nhad not been provoked by an outside cause. It just left the road. One theory is\nthat the driver had fallen asleep behind the wheel. People close to the businessman\nsay that none of the two survivors (Miroglio and the driver, who, both, had\nbeen wearing seatbelts \u2013 the only thing that saved them) remembered anything\nfrom the moment just before the crash. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After the crash, the Italian&#8217;s shares in Technomarket fell\ninto Peevski\u2019s hands. Miroglio later transferred his assets in \u201cDunarit\u201d to the\n\u201cViafot\u201d offshore.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After the disclosure of Alexander Angelov as the undisputed\nultimate owner of \u201cViafot\u201d, the question arises as to <strong>the origin of the EUR 19.563 million<\/strong> that \u201cViafot Invest Bulgaria\u201d\npaid for the transfer. If the money is his own, has he declared it and paid\ntaxes on it?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Approached for comment by phone, lawyer Angelov refused to\nanswer any questions by Bivol regarding his connection with \u201cViafot\u201d:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201c<em>I do not care what\nthis is about. I do not want to comment on anything related to you. Am I clear\nenough<\/em>?\u201d is how Angelov cut us off and abruptly hung up the phone.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Is Angelov a proxy or a puppeteer?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As Bivol&#8217;s investigations into TGI Middle East<a href=\"https:\/\/bivol.bg\/en\/how-much-does-peevski-weigh-bgn-1-5-billion.html\"> revealed<\/a>, the business empire linked to Peevski has been growing through the years and has exceeded the threshold of USD 1 billion. In addition, the cigarettes factory Bulgartabak, also linked to Peevski, is involved in <a href=\"https:\/\/bivol.bg\/en\/customs-documents-bulgartabac-generates-billions-from-smuggling.html\">large scale smuggling<\/a> of cigarettes in the Middle East.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the questions and the speculations about Peevski&#8217;s true role and whether he is an &#8220;independent player&#8221; or a puppet, a front for other powerful shady people who act behind the curtains, date from a while back<g class=\"gr_ gr_6 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Style replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"6\" data-gr-id=\"6\">.<\/g><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The fact that Angelov, a person so close to Peevski and so much trusted by him, is the ultimate beneficiary and owner of the offshore, is very important, because, on the one hand, it indicates the MP&#8217;s interests in &#8220;Dunarit&#8221; and on the other &#8211; it shows that in the system established by the country&#8217;s backstage rulers, Peevski does not seem to be a decision maker. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is obvious that Peevski does not own assets directly. They are owned by individuals such as Angelov and Geno Andreev, people who are <strong>\u201cblood-related\u201d to the State Security (DS) through their fathers.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This structure also means that the &#8220;successful young\nman&#8221; (Peevski) can be replaced anytime by another puppet, without the\ncollapse of the \u201cCaptured State\u201d which will continue to function.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>About the Panama Papers<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Panama_Papers\">Panama Papers<\/a>&#8221; are 11.5 million leaked documents that detail financial and attorney\u2013client information for more than 214,488 offshore entities. The documents, some dating back to the 1970s, were created by, and taken from, Panamanian law firm and corporate service provider Mossack &amp; Fonseca, and were leaked in 2015 by an anonymous source to the German newspaper <em>S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung<\/em>.
